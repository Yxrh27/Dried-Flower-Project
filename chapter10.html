  <h2>Chapter 10: Looming</h2>

  <p>It had been a few days since the Battle of the Wits, and the buzz around school had started to die down. Kaito found himself walking to class with a new sense of ease, though he couldn’t shake the lingering thoughts about Yumi’s sudden reappearance. He’d managed to push it aside for now, immersing himself in school life—and in growing closer to his friends. Especially one friend.</p>

  <p>“Kaito! Hurry up, you’re so slow today!” Miyu called out, skipping ahead as she waved at him. She was practically bouncing with energy.</p>

  <p>“I’m coming,” Kaito replied, picking up his pace. He gave her a mock glare. “I don’t get why you’re always so hyper this early.”</p>

  <p>“Because I have a healthy lifestyle!” Miyu shot back, standing proudly. Then she squinted at him. “Unlike you, who probably stays up late brooding over quizzes or something.”</p>

  <p>Kaito rolled his eyes, but his lips curled into a smile. “If by brooding, you mean catching up on homework, then yeah.”</p>

  <p>“Laaame,” Miyu teased, poking him in the ribs as they walked. “But hey, I guess that’s what makes you, you, Mr. Third Place.”</p>

  <p>“You were part of the team too, remember?” Kaito said, giving her a playful shove in return.</p>

  <p>Miyu grinned and threw her arm around his shoulder in a sisterly way. “Yeah, but I don’t need the glory. I’m just here to keep you in line, bro.”</p>

  <p>“That’s rich, coming from you,” Kaito laughed.</p>

  <p>Just then, Ryo appeared out of nowhere, slinging an arm around Kaito’s other shoulder. “So, what are we talking about? More quizzes? More Miyu pretending to be your big sister?”</p>

  <p>Kaito chuckled as Ryo wiggled his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>Miyu smirked. “Hey, don’t make it weird. I’m just being a responsible friend. Unlike you, Ryo.”</p>

  <p>Ryo threw his hands up in mock surrender. “What did I do?”</p>

  <p>“You’ve been slacking off ever since the quiz show. Did you even contribute anything?” Miyu pouted, crossing her arms.</p>

  <p>Before Ryo could come up with a witty retort, Hinami walked over to join them. She gave Kaito a soft smile, and instantly, his heart skipped a beat. Ever since their outing at the park, Kaito couldn’t help but feel a shift whenever Hinami was around. It wasn’t just friendship anymore—there was something deeper, though neither of them had said anything.</p>

  <p>“Morning, guys!” Hinami greeted cheerfully, her gaze meeting Kaito’s first before flicking to the others.</p>

  <p>Kaito felt the familiar flutter in his chest, something stirring every time Hinami looked at him. He scratched the back of his neck, suddenly feeling awkward. “Hey, Hinami. Good morning.”</p>

  <p>“Are you guys heading to class?” she asked, standing beside him now.</p>

  <p>“Yup!” Miyu replied, slinging an arm around Hinami too. “We’re all sticking together, like glue.”</p>

  <p>Hinami laughed, a soft, melodic sound that made Kaito’s heart race. He noticed how her eyes sparkled when she laughed, how simply being near her made him more aware of his own feelings.</p>

  <p>“Oh, Kaito,” Hinami said suddenly, turning toward him, “I was wondering… are you free this weekend? I need help with something for the research project, and I thought maybe we could work on it together.”</p>

  <p>Kaito’s heart leaped into his throat. Was she asking him to hang out? Alone?</p>

  <p>“Y-Yeah,” Kaito stammered, trying to sound calm. “I’m free.”</p>

  <p>“Great!” Hinami beamed, and for a moment, Kaito was certain he saw a hint of excitement in her eyes. He remembered how during their last outing, Hinami had taken the lead, making him realize how much he enjoyed her company. Her warmth and kindness were becoming harder to ignore.</p>

  <p>Miyu, who had been watching this entire exchange with a growing smirk, suddenly bumped her hip into Kaito’s. “Well, look at you two, getting all chummy.”</p>

  <p>Kaito flushed. “It’s just for the project, Miyu.”</p>

  <p>“Sure, sure,” Miyu teased, leaning closer. “Don’t get too flustered, bro. I’m just looking out for you.”</p>

  <p>Hinami blinked, clearly confused but smiling politely. “What’s going on?”</p>

  <p>“Oh, nothing,” Miyu hummed, giving Kaito a knowing look before skipping ahead with Ryo, who was clearly enjoying Kaito’s squirming.</p>

  <p>As they walked to class, Kaito felt the closeness between him and Hinami grow more natural. He stole glances at her, each one making his heart beat just a little faster. There was a softness in the way she spoke to him, the way she subtly leaned in when they talked. It wasn’t like before—this was different. Something unspoken hung in the air between them, and Kaito wasn’t sure how to act on it yet.</p>

  <p>But as they walked into the classroom, that light, fluttery feeling was replaced with a sudden weight in his chest. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Yumi—standing just outside, watching them. Her presence was like a cold breeze, cutting through the warmth he had been feeling all morning.</p>

  <p>“Kaito?” Hinami asked softly, noticing the shift in his mood. She leaned in closer, her voice gentle. “Everything okay?”</p>

  <p>Kaito forced a smile, not wanting to worry her. “Yeah. I’m fine.”</p>

  <p>But the unease remained, even as they took their seats. Hinami’s presence was comforting, but Yumi’s shadow loomed, threatening to pull him back into the past.</p>

  <p>During class, Kaito found himself distracted by small interactions with Hinami. She would point out something in her notes and lean close to show him, their hands brushing ever so slightly. Every time it happened, his heart would leap, and he’d glance at her, wondering if she felt it too. Her smile was soft, reassuring, and it felt like they were sharing something private—something only the two of them understood.</p>

  <p>At one point, Miyu caught him staring at Hinami and stifled a laugh. She nudged Ryo, whispering something that made him grin. Kaito pretended not to notice, focusing instead on Hinami’s calm voice as she explained part of the lesson.</p>

  <p>After class, as they packed up their things, Hinami turned to Kaito, her smile a little shyer than usual. “I’m looking forward to this weekend. We’ll make a good team, right?”</p>

  <p>Kaito nodded, feeling his chest tighten in that all-too-familiar way. “Yeah. We’ll make a great team.”</p>

  <p>As they walked out of the classroom together, Yumi’s figure had vanished, but the tension in Kaito’s chest hadn’t. Still, he couldn’t help but feel that being around Hinami made it easier to push the past aside—at least for now.</p>
