  <h2>Chapter 7: Countdown to the Quiz Bee</h2>
  <p>The air in the library buzzed with nervous energy as Kaito, Miyu, and Rin sat around one of the larger tables, textbooks and practice quizzes spread out in front of them. The prefecture-level quiz bee was only a few days away, and their teacher had insisted they use every spare moment to prepare.</p>

  <p>Kaito flipped through a thick science textbook, trying to focus, but his mind kept wandering. The pressure was building, and despite his calm exterior, he could feel the weight of expectations pressing down on him.</p>

  <p>“This is boring,” Miyu muttered, tapping her pencil against her notebook. “Do we really need to go over this stuff again? We’ve covered it, like, five times.”</p>

  <p>Rin, sitting across from her, didn’t even look up from her book. “Repetition is key. The more we practice, the better our recall will be during the actual competition.”</p>

  <p>Miyu rolled her eyes and glanced at Kaito, smirking. “You agree with her, Kaito? Or are you as bored as I am?”</p>

  <p>Kaito chuckled, leaning back in his chair. “Honestly, I’m somewhere in between. But Rin’s probably right. Better safe than sorry.”</p>

  <p>Rin finally looked up, her sharp gaze settling on Kaito. “Exactly. We can’t afford any mistakes. The other teams will be just as prepared, if not more. We need to be perfect.”</p>

  <p>Miyu groaned. “Perfect, huh? Sounds like a lot of pressure.”</p>

  <p>Kaito glanced at Rin, noting the intensity in her expression. She was serious—almost too serious. While he admired her focus, it made the atmosphere a bit tense. He exchanged a glance with Miyu, who shrugged with a knowing smile.</p>

  <p>Rin cleared her throat. “Let’s do another set of practice questions. I’ll ask, and you both answer. We’ll rotate through the subjects.”</p>

  <p>Miyu leaned forward, resting her chin on her hands. “Sure, go ahead. But if you ask something too easy, I’m going to fall asleep.”</p>

  <p>Rin’s lips twitched, almost forming a smile. “Alright, here’s one to start: What is the second law of thermodynamics?”</p>

  <p>Miyu shot her hand up, mimicking the style of a quiz show. “Ooh, ooh, pick me! It states that entropy in an isolated system will always increase over time. The universe is basically getting messier and messier!”</p>

  <p>Rin nodded, her expression approving. “Correct.”</p>

  <p>Kaito grinned, jumping in. “I guess that explains why my room is always a mess.”</p>

  <p>Miyu snorted. “That’s because you’re lazy, not because of the universe.”</p>

  <p>Rin, though trying to keep a serious demeanor, couldn’t help but let out a soft chuckle. “I’m pretty sure your room falls under ‘avoidable entropy.’”</p>

  <p>Kaito leaned forward, smirking. “I can’t help it. It’s just natural, like the laws of physics.”</p>

  <p>Miyu shook her head, amused. “And here I thought you were the smartest guy in the class.”</p>

  <p>Rin interrupted, her voice firm but less severe than usual. “Let’s keep going. Next question: What’s the formula for calculating kinetic energy?”</p>

  <p>Kaito answered without hesitation. “Kinetic energy equals one-half times mass times velocity squared.”</p>

  <p>Rin gave a quick nod. “Good. Next one’s for you, Miyu: What’s the chemical symbol for tungsten?”</p>

  <p>Miyu frowned, thinking for a moment before answering. “W, right?”</p>

  <p>Rin smiled, clearly pleased. “Correct. See, you both know this stuff. Now we just need to make sure it’s second nature during the competition.”</p>

  <p>Kaito stretched, feeling a bit more relaxed. “Yeah, but we’ve been studying non-stop. It’s starting to feel like my brain’s about to explode.”</p>

  <p>Miyu leaned back in her chair, sighing dramatically. “Same. I need a break. We’ve been at this for hours.”</p>

  <p>Rin, ever focused, glanced at the clock. “We still have an hour left before the library closes. We should at least go through one more set of questions.”</p>

  <p>Miyu pouted, but before she could protest, Kaito stood up, stretching his arms. “How about we take a five-minute break? We’ve earned it, and we’ll be more focused afterward.”</p>

  <p>Rin hesitated, clearly torn between her strict study regimen and the possibility of a small break. After a moment, she relented. “Fine. Five minutes.”</p>

  <p>Miyu shot Kaito a grateful look. “Finally. I was about to lose my mind.”</p>

  <p>As they stretched and moved around the library, Kaito found himself wandering over to the window, looking out at the courtyard below. He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the tension that had been building. The quiz bee was looming over him, and while he didn’t want to admit it, the pressure was starting to get to him.</p>

  <p>Miyu joined him by the window, leaning against the sill. “You okay? You’ve been quieter than usual.”</p>

  <p>Kaito sighed. “I guess I’m just feeling the pressure. I mean, Rin’s been the top student, and you’re practically a genius. I don’t want to let either of you down.”</p>

  <p>Miyu raised an eyebrow. “Kaito, you’re one of the smartest people I know. You’re not going to let anyone down. Besides, Rin’s intense, but even she can’t do this alone.”</p>

  <p>He glanced at her, grateful for the reassurance. “Thanks. I guess I just need to stop overthinking it.”</p>

  <p>Miyu smiled, giving him a playful nudge. “That’s your problem. You think too much. Just relax a bit, and you’ll be fine.”</p>

  <p>As they talked, Rin approached, her arms crossed. “Break’s over. Ready to get back to it?”</p>

  <p>Miyu groaned. “Already? You really don’t know the meaning of the word ‘rest,’ do you?”</p>

  <p>Rin gave a small smile. “I prefer ‘efficient use of time.’”</p>

  <p>Kaito chuckled, joining them back at the table. “Alright, let’s finish strong.”</p>

  <p>The three of them dove back into their studies, the atmosphere lighter than before. Rin quizzed them relentlessly, pushing them harder with each question, but this time, there was a sense of camaraderie between them. Even though Rin was strict, Kaito could see that she was invested in their success.</p>

  <p>As the library’s closing bell rang, Rin gathered her books, her expression as serious as ever. “We’ve made good progress, but we still have work to do. I expect you both to review what we covered tonight.”</p>

  <p>Miyu rolled her eyes. “Of course, teacher Rin.”</p>

  <p>Rin gave her a long look before turning to Kaito. “Don’t let the pressure get to you, Kaito. You’re more than capable of handling this.”</p>

  <p>Kaito blinked, surprised by her words. Rin wasn’t the type to offer compliments lightly. He smiled, feeling a bit more confident. “Thanks, Rin. I’ll give it my best.”</p>

  <p>As they left the library, walking out into the cool evening air, Kaito felt the tension in his shoulders begin to ease. The quiz bee was still a few days away, but for the first time, he felt like they were ready.</p>

  <p>And whatever happened, he wasn’t facing it alone.</p>
