<h2>Chapter 14: Promise</h2>

<p>A week before Valentine’s Day, Kaito and Ryo sat side by side in their usual spot in the school courtyard, casually munching on their lunch. Students around them were already chatting about their Valentine’s plans, and the excitement in the air was contagious.</p>

<p>Ryo nudged Kaito, flashing him a sly grin. “So, got any big plans for Valentine’s Day?”</p>

<p>Kaito chuckled, feeling his cheeks warm just a little. “I don’t know if they’re ‘big’ plans, but… I was thinking of giving Hinami some flowers, maybe something simple.”</p>

<p>“Simple, huh?” Ryo smirked. “Knowing you, you’ve probably put more thought into those flowers than you’re letting on.”</p>

<p>Kaito shrugged, though he couldn’t help but smile. “I guess I just want her to know I appreciate her. Nothing too flashy.”</p>

<p>Ryo nodded thoughtfully, then hesitated before saying, “I was thinking… maybe I’d do something for Miyu, too. Just, you know, as friends.”</p>

<p>Kaito raised an eyebrow, grinning. “Oh? And I bet you’ve ‘just as friends’ totally planned it out, right?”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” Ryo laughed, pushing him playfully. “It’s not that serious, okay? I just thought… I don’t know, maybe it’d be nice to let her know I care.”</p>

<p>They shared a grin, a silent understanding passing between them. Valentine’s Day would be a new chapter for both of them, in their own ways.</p>

<hr>

<p>When Valentine’s Day arrived, the school was buzzing with excitement. Kaito had spent the morning going over everything in his head, rehearsing what he’d say to Hinami when he handed her the flowers. He’d chosen a bouquet of the <em>Hydrangea macrophylla</em> flower with three different colors—a mix of blue, purple, and pink. Each color meant something different, but he’d decided not to overthink it. He just wanted it to feel natural.</p>

<p>He spotted Hinami near the school entrance, talking to a friend. Taking a deep breath, he walked over, feeling a mix of nerves and excitement.</p>

<p>“Hey, Hinami,” he called, his voice a bit softer than he’d intended.</p>

<p>She turned, her eyes widening slightly when she saw him holding the bouquet. Her cheeks tinted with a soft blush as she offered him a warm smile. “Kaito, are those… for me?”</p>

<p>“Uh, yeah,” he said, scratching the back of his neck. “Just a small gesture. I… wanted to give you something special today.”</p>

<p>Hinami took the bouquet, her fingers brushing lightly against his as she accepted it. She gazed at the flowers with a smile that seemed to carry a hint of surprise, maybe even something deeper. “Thank you, Kaito. They’re beautiful.”</p>

<p>He felt his heart lift at her reaction. “I’m glad you like them.”</p>

<p>For a moment, they simply stood there, both a little too shy to say anything more. But then she looked up at him, her eyes softening. “This really means a lot. Thank you.”</p>

<p>Kaito nodded, a quiet happiness filling him as he watched her admire the flowers. There was a certain unspoken connection between them, one that felt so full yet fragile, as if it could vanish with a single word left unsaid. But he decided not to dwell on it, enjoying the moment for what it was.</p>

<hr>

<p>Meanwhile, Ryo found himself waiting near the school’s back gate, where he knew Miyu would pass on her way to her next class. He’d prepared a small gift—a tiny charm that looked like a cat with a mischievous grin. It was playful, just like her, and he hoped it would bring out a smile.</p>

<p>He spotted her walking toward him, her usual cheerful energy lighting up her face. “Hey, Miyu,” he called out, leaning against the gate with a casual grin.</p>

<p>“Ryo!” she exclaimed, jogging over to him. “What’s up?”</p>

<p>Ryo held out the charm, clearing his throat. “It’s nothing fancy, but… here.”</p>

<p>Miyu blinked in surprise, taking the charm with a growing smile. “A cat charm? This is so cute, Ryo!”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I thought it kind of suited you,” he said, trying to keep his tone light. But there was something in his eyes—a soft warmth that he didn’t quite try to hide.</p>

<p>Miyu looked down at the charm, her cheeks tinged pink as she toyed with it between her fingers. “Thanks, Ryo. Really. This is… really sweet of you.”</p>

<p>“Just don’t tell anyone I have a soft side, okay?” he teased, though he couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.</p>

<p>“Your secret’s safe with me,” she laughed, nudging him playfully. But for a moment, they stood there, her fingers lingering on the charm as she gazed at him, as if trying to figure out just what this moment meant.</p>

<p>They shared a quiet look, the laughter fading as something unspoken settled between them. Miyu felt her heart flutter, caught off guard by the softness in Ryo’s gaze, but she quickly brushed it off with a shy smile. “Anyway, I’ll keep this charm with me. Thanks again, Ryo.”</p>

<p>He nodded, watching her walk away, feeling a quiet contentment, yet a strange, thrilling sense of something more.</p>

<hr>

<p>Later in the day, Kaito and Hinami found themselves sitting on a bench in the courtyard, the flowers resting on her lap. The sun was starting to set, casting a warm, golden glow over everything. Kaito couldn’t help but glance at her, taking in how serene she looked, even with the faint distance that had started to linger between them.</p>

<p>“You’re quiet today,” he noted gently, his eyes meeting hers.</p>

<p>She looked up, the softness in her gaze returning as she smiled. “Just… thinking about things. Today was nice.”</p>

<p>Kaito nodded, feeling a warmth bloom in his chest. “Yeah, it was.”</p>

<p>For a moment, neither of them spoke, both caught in a quiet peace that felt rare and precious. Kaito wanted to say something more, maybe confess the feelings he’d been holding onto. But as he looked at her, with the bouquet resting in her hands, he decided against it, choosing instead to savor the moment.</p>

<p>The flowers, vibrant and full of life, seemed to mirror his feelings for her. But deep down, he couldn’t shake the thought that they might fade in time, just as all things do.</p>

<hr>

<p>As the day wound down, each of them went their separate ways with a sense of quiet satisfaction. Kaito felt content, knowing he’d shown Hinami how much she meant to him, while Ryo’s gift to Miyu had given him a new sense of confidence in his feelings.</p>

<p>But underneath the happiness of the day, there lingered a sense of uncertainty—a fragile hope mixed with the quiet fear that things might change. And as Hinami walked away with the bouquet in her hands, the flowers felt like a beautiful yet fleeting promise, one that would last just as long as they allowed it to.</p>
