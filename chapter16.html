<h2>Chapter 16: Drift</h2>

<p>The week slipped by in agonizingly slow increments, each day adding a heavier weight to Kaito’s heart. Hinami had been pulling back, almost like she was on the other side of a widening chasm. At first, Kaito had tried to shrug it off. Everyone has their ups and downs, right? But soon, the signs became impossible to ignore.</p>

<p>She’d begun canceling plans more frequently, her excuses polite but vague—something about being busy, about needing to stay home. Their once-regular conversations had started to feel hollow, the words dancing just on the surface, never quite reaching deeper like they used to.</p>

<p>Kaito found himself staring at his phone more than he liked to admit, scrolling through their old messages and lingering on her picture in his contacts. He couldn’t understand it. Had he done something wrong? The question weighed on him, gnawing at the edges of his thoughts even in moments meant for laughter or focus.</p>

<p>It was a Friday afternoon when Kaito finally decided to confront her. They were walking down the corridor after school, their footsteps echoing in the nearly empty hallway. Hinami walked beside him, her arms crossed and her gaze distant, as though her mind were a thousand miles away.</p>

<p>“Hina,” he said, his voice tentative. She looked up, startled, as if pulled from some far-off daydream.</p>

<p>“What’s up, Kaito?”</p>

<p>He swallowed, choosing his words carefully. “I… I just wanted to check in. You’ve been distant lately. I feel like we’re not…” His voice faltered, but he pushed on. “I feel like we’re not as close as we used to be. Did I… do something wrong?”</p>

<p>She shook her head quickly, the denial almost too quick, her eyes not quite meeting his. “No, no, you didn’t do anything wrong. It’s… it’s just me.”</p>

<p>“Just you?” he echoed, not quite satisfied. He reached out to touch her arm, hoping to anchor her in this moment. “Hinami, you can talk to me. Whatever it is, I want to help.”</p>

<p>She glanced down, shifting under his gaze. Her mouth opened as though she were about to say something, but then she shook her head again, a forced smile tugging at her lips. “It’s really nothing, Kaito. I’ve just been… distracted. You know how it is.”</p>

<p>His hand dropped, and a hollow ache settled in his chest. He didn’t want to push her, but he felt like he was losing her, and he had no idea how to hold on. “Yeah… I guess,” he murmured, though his heart resisted the words.</p>

<p>They walked in silence after that, an uncomfortable tension filling the space between them, heavy and unspoken. It was only when they reached the school gates that she gave him a small wave, a feeble attempt at normalcy.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you around, okay?” she said, and without waiting for his response, she turned and walked away, leaving him standing alone.</p>

<hr>

<p>That night, Kaito laid in bed, staring at the ceiling, his mind replaying every word of their conversation. He wanted to believe her, but there was a hollowness to her assurances, an emptiness in her eyes that didn’t match her words.</p>

<p>He found his thoughts drifting to Yumi, his ex from ninth grade. Their breakup had been painful, but he’d convinced himself that he was over it, that he’d moved on. Yet, as he felt Hinami slipping away, a part of him couldn’t help but remember how it had felt with Yumi—the slow, gradual distancing, the unspoken withdrawal. The similarities were too close for comfort.</p>

<p>No, he reminded himself firmly. This was different. He was different now. And Hinami wasn’t Yumi. He wouldn’t let his insecurities get the better of him.</p>

<p>But even as he tried to reassure himself, he couldn’t shake the fear gnawing at the edges of his mind. What if he was losing her?</p>

<hr>

<p>The weekend brought a small reprieve, though not one that Kaito could find much solace in. He, Ryo, and Miyu had planned to meet up at the mall, and for a few hours, he was able to set aside his worries.</p>

<p>As they wandered through the arcade, Miyu and Ryo exchanged teasing banter, their laughter infectious. Ryo, in particular, seemed determined to win Miyu a prize, and Kaito watched with a hint of amusement as his friend concentrated on the claw machine, his tongue sticking out as he maneuvered the joystick.</p>

<p>“Come on, almost there… almost…” Ryo muttered, his gaze fixed on the stuffed animal dangling precariously from the claw. With a triumphant shout, he managed to drop the toy into the chute, retrieving it with a proud grin.</p>

<p>Miyu clapped her hands, clearly delighted. “You actually got it! I thought you’d given up after the first five tries.”</p>

<p>He handed her the stuffed bear, his grin widening. “See? I told you I’d get it eventually.”</p>

<p>Kaito smiled, watching the two of them with a sense of warmth. It was clear to him that something special was growing between them, a gentle, unspoken connection that seemed to flow easily, naturally. He was happy for them, genuinely so. But it also reminded him, painfully, of what he felt slipping through his fingers.</p>

<p>They spent the next couple of hours wandering around the mall, Ryo and Miyu keeping the atmosphere light with their teasing and playful arguments. For a while, Kaito allowed himself to be swept up in their laughter, grateful for the distraction. But every now and then, he’d catch a glimpse of his phone, half-expecting a message from Hinami, only to be met with silence.</p>

<hr>

<p>On Sunday evening, Kaito sat alone at the park bench, the one he and Hinami used to sit on after school. The park was quiet, a cool breeze rustling through the leaves as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the world in hues of orange and purple.</p>

<p>He stared at his phone, his fingers hovering over the screen. He wanted to reach out to her, to ask her if she’d like to talk, to tell her that he was there for her. But something held him back—a fear of pushing too hard, of making her pull away even more.</p>

<p>As he debated, he felt a wave of loneliness wash over him, a sense of isolation that he couldn’t shake. He missed her presence, the way she’d laugh at his silly jokes, the way her eyes would light up when she was passionate about something. He missed them—the way they used to be.</p>

<p>His phone vibrated, and for a brief, hopeful second, he thought it might be her. But it was just a message from Ryo, reminding him about a project they had due the next week.</p>

<p>Kaito let out a heavy sigh, setting his phone aside and leaning back against the bench. He closed his eyes, letting the cool air brush over him, hoping it might somehow ease the ache inside him. But the emptiness remained, persistent and unyielding.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next morning at school, Kaito’s heart sank when he spotted Hinami by her locker, her gaze distant as she organized her books. She looked tired, almost fragile, as if the weight of whatever she was carrying was beginning to wear her down.</p>

<p>He approached her carefully, not wanting to startle her. “Morning, Hina.”</p>

<p>She glanced up, a faint smile flickering across her face, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “Morning, Kaito.”</p>

<p>The silence that followed was heavy, and he could feel her pulling away even in this small moment. He tried to catch her gaze, to find some hint of the girl he knew so well, but she was already looking away, her attention focused on the papers in her locker.</p>

<p>Kaito swallowed, his chest tightening. “Are you free today after school?”</p>

<p>She hesitated, her fingers pausing on the edge of her notebook. “I don’t think I can today,” she said softly. “Something came up.”</p>

<p>He nodded, masking his disappointment with a forced smile. “Yeah, sure. Maybe another time.”</p>

<p>The bell rang, and she quickly closed her locker, giving him a small wave before slipping into the crowd. He watched her go, feeling the distance between them widen with each step she took.</p>

<hr>

<p>That night, as he lay in bed, Kaito stared at the ceiling, feeling the weight of everything pressing down on him. He wanted to fight for her, to bridge the gap that had formed between them, but he was terrified of pushing her further away.</p>

<p>For the first time, he wondered if he’d already lost her—if this distance was something he couldn’t fix, no matter how hard he tried.</p>

<p>And as he drifted into a restless sleep, he was haunted by a single, painful question: What if this was the beginning of the end?</p>
