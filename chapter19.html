<h2>Chapter 19: Shadow</h2>

<p>Days passed, yet the ache in Kaito’s chest didn’t lessen. If anything, it grew heavier, a dull weight that settled over him and lingered in every corner of his mind. The world moved around him as it always had, but he felt like he was sleepwalking through it, disconnected from everything he’d once cared about. Each morning, he dragged himself to school, hoping the routine might eventually numb the pain. But each glance down the hall, every casual conversation, every shared smile between couples reminded him of Hinami.</p>

<p>He’d hear her laugh sometimes—a figment, a memory—echoing in his head when he least expected it, like a song he couldn’t forget. Whenever he looked at the empty desk beside him, he felt his heart twist, a painful reminder of what he’d lost. People noticed his silence, but few dared to bring it up, and he was grateful for that. Even his close friends, Ryo and Miyu, seemed unsure how to approach him, their usual light-hearted jabs softer, tentative, as if they feared they might reopen wounds that were already too raw.</p>

<p><em>Focus on school,</em> he told himself each day, clinging to the semblance of a routine. But even that felt hollow, like he was trying to build a shelter out of fragments of his former life. His grades, his passion, his plans for the future—they all felt meaningless without Hinami there to share them with. She’d been the one who pushed him to be better, who believed in him even when he doubted himself. And now, with her absence looming over him like a shadow, he felt directionless.</p>

<p>During lunch breaks, he often caught himself glancing toward the spots where they used to sit together, his heart sinking when he saw the empty space beside him. He’d walk past the places they’d shared moments, snippets of laughter and whispered secrets echoing back at him from the remote place of his memory. No matter how much he tried, he couldn’t escape her.</p>

<p>Ryo, sensing his withdrawal, occasionally tried to break him out of it. “Hey, Kaito,” he said one day, nudging him as they sat in the cafeteria. “You should join Miyu and me at the arcade this weekend. We’re planning on going to that new place that just opened.”</p>

<p>Kaito managed a small smile, but it felt forced, fragile. “Thanks, Ryo. Maybe… maybe another time.”</p>

<p>Miyu, sitting across from him, looked at him with a mix of worry and sympathy. “Kaito… I know it hurts right now,” she said gently, her usual teasing tone replaced with quiet sincerity. “But we’re here for you. Don’t shut us out, okay?”</p>

<p>He nodded, grateful for their concern, even if he wasn’t quite ready to accept it. “I appreciate it, really. Just… give me some time.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Across town, Hinami was struggling just as much. Each night, after the quiet settled and her parents’ arguments faded into the walls, she found herself alone with her thoughts, and that was when the weight of her decision truly hit her. She’d done it for the right reasons, she reminded herself over and over. Kaito deserved someone who could love him without hesitation, without all the baggage that she carried. But no matter how much she tried to convince herself, the emptiness gnawed at her.</p>

<p>Lying in bed, she replayed memories of their time together, her chest tightening with each bittersweet recollection. The way he’d look at her with those warm, understanding eyes, the laughter they’d shared, the promises they’d whispered to each other on quiet nights—every moment with him had been precious. And now, in the silence of her room, those memories felt like a lifeline she couldn’t let go of, no matter how much she knew she needed to.</p>

<p>Some nights, when she couldn’t sleep, she’d find herself scrolling through their old messages, rereading the words that once held so much hope, words that now felt like ghostly reminders of what could never be. She’d linger over his smiling photos, her fingers hovering over the screen as if touching his image could somehow bring him closer.</p>

<p>Her resolve wavered. <em>Did I make a mistake?</em> she’d wonder, the question lingering like a haunting melody. But every time her heart ached for him, she forced herself to remember why she’d let him go. It was for the best. She wasn’t what he needed. She wasn’t the person who could stand beside him without bringing him down. Even if her heart screamed otherwise, she clung to the belief that leaving him was the right thing to do.</p>

<hr>

<p>One afternoon, as Kaito walked out of his last class, he felt someone tap him on the shoulder. He turned, surprised to find Yumi standing there. Her expression was conflicted, a hint of nervousness in her eyes, but there was also something determined in her gaze.</p>

<p>“Kaito, can we talk?” she asked, her voice quiet but steady.</p>

<p>He nodded, slightly taken aback. They hadn’t spoken much since their breakup, and he wasn’t sure what she wanted to say now. He followed her out to the courtyard, where they found a quiet bench away from the other students.</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a moment, neither of them knowing quite where to start. Yumi fidgeted with her bag strap before taking a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Kaito,” she began, her voice soft but filled with regret, “before I say anything else… I want to apologize.”</p>

<p>Her words caught him off guard. He blinked, turning to her fully as she continued.</p>

<p>“When we broke up, I said some really harsh things. Comparing you to someone else… it wasn’t fair, and it wasn’t true. I said it out of spite, and I’ve regretted it ever since.”</p>

<p>Kaito felt a sharp pang of guilt. He had tried to forget those words, convincing himself they didn’t matter anymore. But now, hearing her apology, it all came flooding back.</p>

<p>“No, Yumi,” he said quietly, shaking his head. “You don’t need to apologize. I was immature back then. I didn’t know how to handle things, and… I probably gave you reasons to feel that way. I wasn’t the best boyfriend. I avoided things that mattered and acted selfishly. It wasn’t just you.”</p>

<p>Yumi blinked, her surprise evident. “Kaito… you were trying your best. I didn’t see that at the time. I was so caught up in my own feelings that I couldn’t acknowledge what you were going through. I lashed out because I didn’t know how else to deal with it.”</p>

<p>Kaito looked down, her words hitting harder than he expected. “I think we both messed up,” he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. “But I’ve thought a lot about it since then. And… I want to say I’m sorry too. I avoided the hard conversations. I didn’t consider your feelings enough. I thought… if I just ignored things, they’d fix themselves.”</p>

<p>Yumi gave him a faint smile, her eyes softening. “We were kids, Kaito. We didn’t know any better. But… you’ve grown, haven’t you? I can see it in the way you talk now.”</p>

<p>He hesitated, unsure how to respond. He wasn’t sure he’d grown enough to fix the damage he’d caused, but he wanted to believe he’d changed.</p>

<p>Yumi shifted in her seat, the nervousness in her posture returning. “That’s actually why I wanted to talk to you today. I need to be honest with you,” she said, her voice wavering. “After we broke up… I thought I could just move on, you know? But I haven’t been able to. Not completely.”</p>

<p>Kaito stiffened slightly, her words making his chest tighten. He stayed silent, letting her continue.</p>

<p>“I still… I still have feelings for you,” she admitted, looking up at him with a mixture of hope and vulnerability. “And I know you’ve been through a lot lately. I know things are complicated, especially with Hinami, but I just… I needed to tell you how I feel.”</p>

<p>Her confession hit him like a wave. She was brave, confronting her emotions like this, even knowing how complicated his situation was. Kaito knew deep down that he still had feelings for Hinami even though they weren't together anymore. Therefore, he knew what he had to say, even if it hurt her.</p>

<p>“I…” Kaito hesitated, looking down at his hands. “Yumi, I… I should have talked to you sooner. I’ve been avoiding you because I thought it would make things easier, but I didn’t think about how it would affect you. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>Yumi’s smile was sad but understanding. “I get it. I’ve been avoiding things too. But when I saw you today, I thought… maybe this is my chance to say everything I’ve been holding back. I don’t want to carry this weight anymore, Kaito. I want closure.”</p>

<p>He nodded, the heaviness of her words settling on his shoulders. “Yumi… you were an important part of my life, and I’ll always be grateful for that. But I’ve moved on. I don’t feel the same way anymore.”</p>

<p>Her face fell, the hurt flashing across her features before she masked it with a small nod. “I figured as much,” she whispered. “But I needed to hear it. I needed to let it all out, so I could stop wondering.”</p>

<p>Kaito swallowed hard, guilt pressing into his chest. “Yumi, you deserve someone who can give you everything you’re looking for. I wish I could have been that person for you, but… I wasn’t, and I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>She stood, her movements slow and deliberate. “Don’t be sorry, Kaito. I’m glad we had this talk. Even if it hurts, it’s better than not knowing.”</p>

<p>She hesitated, glancing back at him one last time. “Take care of yourself, okay? And… I hope you find the happiness you’re looking for.”</p>

<p>As she walked away, Kaito watched her figure fade into the distance. The air around him felt heavier, her words lingering in his mind. He let out a quiet sigh, leaning back on the bench. Yumi had sought closure, and maybe she had found it, but it left him feeling more lost than ever.</p>

<hr>

<p>Yumi’s figure disappeared into the distance, leaving Kaito alone on the bench. He sat there for a while, staring blankly at the path she’d taken, her words echoing in his mind. The guilt lingered, heavier than before, as if her apology had unearthed wounds he thought had healed.</p>

<p>He sighed, running a hand through his hair. Yumi wasn’t wrong—he had grown since their breakup. He had come to terms with his mistakes and accepted that he hadn’t been the person she needed. But hearing it all again, spoken so honestly, made him realize just how much of his past still held him back.</p>

<p>As the sun began to dip below the horizon, Kaito stood, his legs feeling heavy. Without thinking, he began walking, letting his feet guide him. The campus emptied around him, the chatter of students fading into the background as the quiet streets of the town enveloped him.</p>

<p>Before he knew it, Kaito found himself wandering toward the park where he and Hinami had spent so many afternoons together. The memories of those days hit him like a wave, each one a reminder of what he’d lost. They’d come here so many times, sharing secrets under the shade of the trees, laughing as they watched the world go by. Now, the park felt empty, a shadow of the happiness they’d once shared.</p>

<p>He found a bench near the old oak tree, one they’d sat on countless times. He settled onto it, his gaze drifting to the spot where she used to sit beside him, her laughter filling the air as they joked about everything and nothing. He could almost hear her voice, a soft echo in the quiet evening, as if the park itself held fragments of her that he could still hold onto.</p>

<p>The conversation with Yumi replayed in his mind, intertwining with thoughts of Hinami. He wondered if his avoidance of Yumi had mirrored his hesitations with Hinami. Had he been doomed to repeat the same mistakes? Or was this just life, messy and full of regrets no matter how much you tried to grow?</p>

<p>As the sky darkened and stars began to flicker into view, he let himself sink into the memories, embracing the pain and the bittersweet nostalgia. He knew he couldn’t cling to the past forever, but in that moment, he needed to feel close to her, even if it was only through the echoes of their time together.</p>

<p>Kaito sighed, his breath fogging up in the cool night air. He looked up at the stars, his mind filled with what-ifs and might-have-beens. He knew that life would go on, that eventually, the ache in his heart would fade, replaced by new memories, new experiences. But for now, he allowed himself to mourn, to feel the loss of the girl who had been his everything.</p>

<p>Sitting alone on that bench, Kaito closed his eyes, letting the memories wash over him one last time, holding onto the hope that, somehow, somewhere, Hinami was looking up at the same stars, remembering him too.</p>
