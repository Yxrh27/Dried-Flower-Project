    <h1>Dried Flower – Ref:rain</h1>
    <h2>Prologue: Echoes of a Fading Spring</h2>

    <p>The weeks after the completion ceremony passed in a blur of warm winds, quiet mornings, and the soft hum of life continuing on, even if something inside Kaito hadn’t quite caught up.</p>

    <p>His room remained much the same—textbooks half-stacked on the desk, his faded school bag hanging on the wall, and on the corner of the shelf, the photograph he once placed face-down of him and Hinami now stood upright again. He hadn’t touched it since that night. He just... noticed it there one morning, and didn’t have the heart to hide it again.</p>

    <p>Summer came and went in quiet days spent mostly at home, or with Miyu and Ryo.</p>

    <p>They had grown closer than ever.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">***</div>

    <p>It hadn’t even needed a dramatic announcement. One afternoon in July, the three of them had met up at the local café to escape the heat, like they always did. Ryo was nursing a bottle of iced coffee, grinning like an idiot, and Miyu had looked at Kaito with this smug little tilt of her head and said,</p>

    <p><strong>“By the way, Ryo’s mine now.”</strong></p>

    <p>Just like that. No build-up. No dramatic confession. Just Miyu being Miyu.</p>

    <p>Ryo had blinked in mock betrayal. <strong>“Excuse me, I thought <em>you</em> were mine.”</strong></p>

    <p><strong>“Same thing,”</strong> she shot back with a wink, stealing a fry off his plate.</p>

    <p>Kaito had laughed—really laughed—for the first time in what felt like weeks. Maybe even months.</p>

    <p>He’d congratulated them, teased them, even said <em>“finally”</em> under his breath in that tired older brother tone Miyu always loved to mimic.</p>

    <p>But when he got home that night and sat on his bed, the silence felt louder than usual.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">***</div>

    <p>It wasn’t that he wanted Miyu. Or even that he was jealous of Ryo. No, that wasn’t it. He was happy for them. Truly.</p>

    <p>But there was something about watching them lean into each other so naturally, share little glances and inside jokes, talk about future plans like they had all the time in the world. It just made him think—<em>What if things were different with her?</em></p>
        
    <p>Now, summer is ending.</p>

    <p>It was late afternoon, and the air still clung to the remnants of heat, even as the cicadas began their soft chorus in the trees outside.</p>

    <p>Kaito lay on the wooden floor of his room, his arms folded behind his head, staring up at the ceiling fan spinning lazily above him. A faint breeze from the open window stirred the curtains, and outside, kids were laughing somewhere down the street, chasing the last light of vacation.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow would be the start of senior high school.</p>

    <p>A new year. A new beginning. A new uniform.</p>

    <p>But not a new heart. Not yet.</p>

    <p>His phone buzzed beside him.</p>

    <div class="text-message">
        <p><strong>Miyu 🐾:</strong><br>
        You alive?<br>
        We’re meeting at the station at 7:15 sharp. Don’t be late.<br>
        I swear if you wear wrinkled pants again, I’m bringing an iron.</p>
    </div>

    <p>He smiled faintly, fingers hovering over the screen before tapping a reply.</p>

    <div class="text-message">
        <p><strong>Kaito:</strong><br>
        Yes, mom.<br>
        Pants are fine. Hair, debatable.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Almost instantly:</p>

    <div class="text-message">
        <p><strong>Miyu 🐾:</strong><br>
        Ryo says you should spike it. I say leave it fluffy.<br>
        Come looking like yourself.</p>
    </div>

    <p>He stared at that last message a little longer than he expected.</p>

    <p><em>Come looking like yourself.</em></p>

    <p>Who was that these days?</p>

    <div class="scene-break">***</div>

        <p>He met them the next morning at the station, the sky still pale with early light and the platform unusually quiet.</p>

    <p>Miyu looked fresh, her new uniform ironed to perfection, her short hair tucked behind one ear. She wore a sunflower pin on her collar—knowing her, she probably said it was for luck, but really, she just liked how it looked.</p>

    <p>Ryo, ever casual, leaned against the rail with his bag slung over one shoulder, offering Kaito a lazy wave when he approached.</p>

    <p>“You look half-awake,” Ryo said, inspecting him with a squint. “But the pants are acceptable.”</p>

    <p>Miyu nodded solemnly. “He passes.”</p>

    <p>Kaito just raised an eyebrow. “Did I walk into an interview panel?”</p>

    <p>“You’re welcome,” Miyu chirped. “We’re quality control. We don’t let just anyone into senior high.”</p>

    <p>“Good,” Kaito replied dryly. “Because I definitely don’t feel like I belong here yet.”</p>

    <p>There was a pause.</p>

    <p>Ryo glanced at him sideways. “Still thinking about her?”</p>

    <p>He didn’t answer.</p>

    <p>Didn’t need to.</p>

    <p>Miyu softened. “She’ll be there today. You okay with that?”</p>

    <p>“Yeah,” Kaito said after a moment. “I think so.”</p>

    <p>The train came with its familiar rumble and hiss, and the three of them boarded silently, the soft morning light casting their reflections in the windows as they settled into their seats.</p>

    <p>The town outside rolled by slowly, but Kaito’s thoughts moved slower still.</p>

    <p>This was a new year.</p>

    <p>But ghosts didn’t vanish with a flip of a calendar.</p>

    <p>Not when their memory still lived in your chest like a quiet song you couldn’t stop humming.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">***</div>

        <p>The school gates felt unfamiliar.</p>

    <p>Even though it was the same campus, the same concrete path lined with trees that hadn’t changed in years, something about walking through them that morning made Kaito feel like a stranger.</p>

    <p>Maybe it was the new building renovations they’d started over the summer. Or maybe it was the new uniforms the senior high students wore—sharper collars, deeper navy, a shift from adolescence to something that tried to resemble maturity. Or maybe it was just the weight of knowing this was the beginning of their final two years here.</p>

    <p>Miyu stretched as they walked toward the courtyard, her bag bouncing behind her. “I missed this place. I don’t even care if that sounds weird.”</p>

    <p>Ryo scoffed. “You missed school? Who are you?”</p>

    <p>“I missed the routine,” she said, waving at some classmates they hadn’t seen in weeks. “And the air-con. Mostly the air-con.”</p>

    <p>Kaito gave a small smile. The courtyard was already filling up—familiar faces mingling with new ones. A few people waved to them, a couple more shouted “Ryo!” or “Miyu!” across the grass. It was strange seeing everyone back in their uniforms again, taller than before, more tired maybe, but still unmistakably the same people they’d grown up with.</p>

    <p>That’s when he saw her.</p>

    <p>Hinami.</p>

    <p>She was standing near the edge of the courtyard, talking to a few girls from their class. Her hair was a little shorter than before, just brushing her shoulders now, and she wore the new uniform like it had been tailored just for her—neat, composed, elegant in that quiet way she always carried herself.</p>

    <p>And then, she glanced up.</p>

    <p>For a moment, their eyes met.</p>

    <p>Kaito stopped walking.</p>

    <p>She didn’t smile.</p>

    <p>She didn’t frown, either.</p>

    <p>Just a small nod. Almost imperceptible.</p>

    <p>Then she turned back to her friends, like nothing had happened.</p>

    <p>“Let’s go,” Ryo said beside him, nudging his elbow gently. “Class lists are going up.”</p>

    <p>They made their way to the bulletin board by the lobby where students were already crowding, pushing and laughing and sighing at their placements.</p>

    <p>“Third floor?” Miyu groaned as she read the list. “Why are we always on the top floor?”</p>

    <p>“Better view,” Ryo shrugged. “More wind.”</p>

    <p>“More stairs,” she snapped. “I’ll literally die before the midterms.”</p>

    <p>Kaito’s eyes ran down the list, and his breath caught when he saw it.</p>

    <p><strong>Section 11-A.<br>
    Kaito Tanaka.<br>
    Miyu Hayashi.<br>
    Ryo Fujimura.<br>
    Hinami Miyamoto.</strong></p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>He stared at the names, and then slowly, quietly, said, “She’s in our class.”</p>

    <p>Miyu paused, peering at the board. “Huh.”</p>

    <p>Ryo just gave a quiet nod. “Guess the universe wants closure.”</p>

    <p>Kaito didn’t reply.</p>

    <p>He wasn’t sure what he wanted anymore.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">***</div>

        <p>Their classroom was clean, whiteboard already dusted, windows letting in the late morning sun. The desks hadn’t changed, the squeaky chairs were still annoyingly loud, and the floor had that faint citrus scent from the janitor’s mop.</p>

    <p>“Front row!” Miyu cheered, tossing her bag on the seat by the window. “Dibs.”</p>

    <p>Ryo raised an eyebrow. “Since when are you a front-row student?”</p>

    <p>“Since I realized I could copy answers faster from you if I sit in front.”</p>

    <p>Kaito took the seat beside them and leaned his arm on the desk. Everything felt like it was moving too fast, even though it was all so… quiet.</p>

    <p>The teacher hadn’t arrived yet. Just the low hum of students getting reacquainted.</p>

    <p>Then came the soft click of shoes in the hallway, and Hinami stepped into the classroom.</p>

    <p>Her eyes scanned the room once, and when they met his again, she hesitated.</p>

    <p>There wasn’t anger. There wasn’t bitterness.</p>

    <p>But there was something like… <em>distance</em>.</p>

    <p>She gave a small, polite bow to the others, walked calmly to the row behind them, and took her seat.</p>

    <p>Miyu shot Kaito a glance.</p>

    <p>Kaito didn’t turn around.</p>

    <p>He couldn’t.</p>

    <p>Not yet.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">***</div>

    <p>Homeroom began shortly after with a loud, overly cheerful teacher who insisted on everyone introducing themselves again despite already knowing each other. The usual jokes flew, the classroom gradually relaxed, and even Kaito managed a few smiles during roll call.</p>

    <p>But something stayed quiet between him and Hinami.</p>

    <p>Not cold.</p>

    <p>Not awkward.</p>

    <p>Just… unresolved.</p>

    <p>Like there was an old song still playing between them, but neither of them dared to listen to the lyrics again.</p>

    <p>The day passed in a blur of introductions, announcements, and back-to-school formalities. Teachers reminded them of their responsibilities as upperclassmen, warned them about upcoming exams, and spoke vaguely about university prep like it was a storm just over the horizon.</p>

    <p>By lunch break, the classroom buzzed with life again. Miyu had already dragged Ryo to the canteen for their “first-day ramen tradition,” leaving Kaito alone by the vending machines outside their building. He stared at the rows of canned drinks, not really craving anything.</p>

    <p>“You’re not eating?”</p>

    <p>The voice was soft.</p>

    <p>Familiar.</p>

    <p>He didn’t have to turn to know who it was.</p>

    <p>“…Not hungry,” he replied after a moment.</p>

    <p>Hinami stepped into view beside him, her expression unreadable. She looked at the drinks too, like she was deciding whether or not to break the silence again.</p>

    <p>They stood there for a while. Just existing near each other.</p>

    <p>Kaito finally said something. “I didn’t expect you to be in the same class again.”</p>

    <p>She looked at him, eyes calm. “Neither did I.”</p>

    <p>He nodded slowly, then added, “But I guess… that’s how it goes.”</p>

    <p>There was a pause. The breeze carried the faint smell of warm asphalt and dried leaves, the dying remnants of summer lingering in the air.</p>

    <p>Hinami broke the silence this time. “I heard you won an award for the research paper last semester.”</p>

    <p>“Yeah,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck. “It was… unexpected. Miyu and Ryo did most of the final edits.”</p>

    <p>“You wrote the framework,” she said. “I remember.”</p>

    <p>Kaito glanced at her. Her eyes weren’t cold. They weren’t warm, either. Just honest.</p>

    <p>“…Thanks,” he said quietly.</p>

    <p>She nodded.</p>

    <p>Then, like the moment had reached its end, she turned to leave. But before she stepped away, she added softly, <strong>“I’m glad you’re doing well, Kaito.”</strong></p>

    <p>He looked at her back as she walked away.</p>

    <p>And it hit him.</p>

    <p>He hadn’t asked her if she was doing okay.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">***</div>

        <p>Later that afternoon, the trio reunited on the rooftop—Miyu clutching a melon bread like it was treasure, Ryo with a canned coffee, and Kaito leaning against the railing, watching the city below.</p>

    <p>The sky stretched wide and clear, painted with faint brushstrokes of orange as the sun began its slow descent. The wind carried the sound of distant chatter and traffic, but up here, it felt like the world had slowed just for them.</p>

    <p>“First day wasn’t too bad, huh?” Ryo said, sipping his drink. “I thought we’d drown in introductions, but it was mostly just teachers rambling.”</p>

    <p>Miyu bit into her bread. “Speak for yourself. I almost died of boredom during math.”</p>

    <p>“That’s because you were drawing doodles instead of listening.”</p>

    <p>“Excuse you, those doodles were masterpieces.”</p>

    <p>Kaito chuckled softly at their usual banter. For a moment, it felt like nothing had changed—that maybe, just maybe, things could go back to the way they were before everything with Hinami had unraveled.</p>

    <p>But deep down, he knew better.</p>

    <p>Ryo noticed the distant look on his face. “You okay, Kaito?”</p>

    <p>“Yeah,” he answered quickly. “Just… thinking.”</p>

    <p>Miyu tilted her head. “About?”</p>

    <p>He hesitated. The truth hovered at the edge of his lips, but he swallowed it down. “Nothing important.”</p>

    <p>“Liar,” Miyu teased, but she didn’t press further. She only smiled, warm and reassuring, like she always did when she sensed he wasn’t ready to talk.</p>

    <p>They stayed up there until the bell rang, watching the sky deepen into shades of amber. The rooftop felt like their secret haven again, untouched by the noise of the world below.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">***</div>

    <p>By the time the final bell rang, the weight of the first day settled over everyone. Students hurried out in groups, laughing, already making after-school plans.</p>

    <p>Kaito walked home alone.</p>

    <p>The streets glowed with the soft light of evening, shadows stretching long across the pavement. His bag felt heavier than it should, the day’s emotions pressing down on him more than the books inside.</p>

    <p>As he turned the corner near the riverbank, he stopped.</p>

    <p>Hinami was there.</p>

    <p>She stood by the railing, her hair catching the last glow of the sunset. The sight was almost surreal—like a memory brought to life.</p>

    <p>For a moment, he considered walking away.</p>

    <p>But his feet carried him forward.</p>

    <p>“Hinami.”</p>

    <p>She turned, her eyes widening just slightly before softening into something unreadable. “Kaito.”</p>

    <p>The river flowed quietly beside them, reflecting the fading colors of the sky. It felt like the entire world was holding its breath.</p>

    <p>He opened his mouth, but no words came out.</p>

    <p>Neither of them spoke for a long time.</p>

    <p>Finally, she said, almost in a whisper, “Do you regret it?”</p>

    <p>His chest tightened. “Regret what?”</p>

    <p>“Us.”</p>

    <p>The word lingered in the air, heavier than the dusk settling around them.</p>

    <p>Kaito clenched his fists at his sides. “No,” he said firmly. “Never.”</p>

    <p>Hinami looked at him, her eyes shimmering with something he couldn’t quite name. Sadness. Longing. Maybe both.</p>

    <p>“Then why…” Her voice trailed off, carried away by the breeze.</p>

    <p>He didn’t answer.</p>

    <p>Because there was no answer. Not one that would make sense. Not one that would make the ache go away.</p>

    <p>She smiled faintly, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “I see.”</p>

    <p>And before he could say anything else, she turned and walked away—her figure gradually swallowed by the deepening night.</p>

    <p>Kaito stood there until the last trace of her disappeared.</p>

    <p>Only then did he let out the breath he’d been holding.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">***</div>

        <p>That night, lying on his bed, Kaito stared at the ceiling in silence. The words replayed in his head again and again—Hinami’s voice, her question, her fading smile.</p>

    <p>“Do you regret it?”</p>

    <p>He thought about his answer. About whether it was the truth, or just what he wanted to believe. But deep down, he knew: he didn’t regret her. He never could.</p>

    <p>What he regretted was that they couldn’t hold on.</p>

    <p>The ceiling blurred as his eyes grew heavy. The first day of the new term had ended, but the weight of it was only beginning.</p>
