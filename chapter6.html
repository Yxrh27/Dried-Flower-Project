    <h2>Chapter 6: A Surprising Challenge</h2>

    <p>It was a regular Tuesday morning, and Kaito sat at his desk, lazily doodling in his notebook while waiting for the teacher to show up. Ryo, seated next to him, was busy flipping through his phone, probably watching TikTok videos, while Miyu leaned back in her chair with her usual smug expression.</p>

    <p>His mind kept wandering back to his time with Hinami the previous weekend. He’d replayed that moment over and over in his head—her words, the way she looked at him, the feeling of her being so close.</p>

    <p>He hadn’t admitted it out loud, but something had changed. There was no denying it anymore—he was falling for her. The realization left him in a strange mix of excitement and uncertainty, and now, every time he saw her in class or passed her in the hallway, his heart raced.</p>

    <p>Miyu’s teasing voice snapped him back to reality. “You’re spacing out again, Kaito. What’s going on with you lately?”</p>

    <p>Kaito shot her a quick glance, hoping she wouldn’t pick up on his thoughts. “Nothing. Just thinking about stuff.”</p>

    <p>Miyu, ever the observant one, smirked knowingly. “Yeah, sure. You’ve been acting weird after the trip to the research facility. Did something happen?”</p>

    <p>Kaito opened his mouth to deny it, but the classroom door suddenly slid open, and in walked their science teacher, clutching a stack of papers. The usual chatter in the room died down as everyone turned their attention toward the front.</p>

    <p>“Alright, everyone, settle down,” the teacher announced, her voice firm. “I have some important news.”</p>

    <p>Kaito straightened in his seat, trying to shake off the lingering thoughts of Hinami.</p>

    <p>“We’re going to have a midterm exam today,” the teacher said, holding up the stack of papers.</p>

    <p>A collective groan rippled through the class. No one had expected this.</p>

    <p>“I knew it,” Miyu whispered to Kaito, nudging him. “Looks like you’re not the only one who’s having a rough day.”</p>

    <p>Kaito sighed. “Great.”</p>

    <hr>

    <p>The midterm exam was more intense than Kaito had expected. Each question felt like a challenge, and he could feel the pressure building as he worked through the problems. His mind, however, remained strangely focused—perhaps thanks to his recent realizations about Hinami.</p>

    <p>He glanced over at Miyu, who was breezing through the questions like it was no big deal. Kaito felt a surge of competitiveness. No way was he letting her outscore him.</p>

    <p>By the time he handed in his paper, he was mentally drained. But something told him he’d done better than he thought.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>The next day, the class buzzed with nervous energy as their teacher walked in, holding the graded exams. Kaito’s heart raced. He wasn’t sure if it was the leftover feelings from last weekend or the nerves of seeing his score, but either way, he couldn’t sit still.</p>

    <p>When the teacher finally reached his desk, she gave him a small smile and handed him his paper. “Well done, Kaito.”</p>

    <p>He flipped it over—100%. Perfect score.</p>

    <p>Miyu leaned over, grinning smugly. “Not bad. Looks like you’re finally catching up to me.”</p>

    <p>Kaito glanced at her paper—she had also scored 100%. “You too, huh?”</p>

    <p>Before they could exchange any more banter, the door opened again, and the head teacher entered, accompanied by a girl Kaito slightly recognizes. She had an air of confidence that immediately caught everyone’s attention.</p>

    <p>“This is Rin Fujimura,” the head teacher announced, gesturing to the girl. “She was the top student last year, and she’ll be joining Kaito and Miyu in representing our class for the upcoming quiz bee competition at the prefecture level.”</p>

    <p>Kaito blinked in surprise. A quiz bee? And he was one of the contestants?</p>

    <p>Miyu seemed more excited than surprised. “A quiz bee? That sounds like fun.”</p>

    <p>Kaito, however, felt a mix of excitement and dread. Competing at the prefecture level was no small thing, and now he had to work alongside Miyu and Rin, both of whom had a reputation for being the best.</p>

    <p>Rin stepped forward, her sharp eyes scanning both Kaito and Miyu. “I look forward to working with you both. I hope you’re ready to give it your all.”</p>

    <p>Miyu flashed a competitive grin. “Don’t worry about us. We’ll do our part.”</p>

    <p>Kaito, on the other hand, felt the pressure building. After everything that had happened with Hinami, the last thing he wanted was another source of stress. But he couldn’t back down now. If there was one thing he knew, it was that he wasn’t going to let Miyu or Rin outshine him without a fight.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>As the head teacher left the room, Rin stayed behind for a moment longer, turning her gaze toward Kaito. “You’re Tanaka, right?”</p>

    <p>Kaito nodded, feeling slightly nervous under her intense stare. “Yeah, that’s me.”</p>

    <p>Rin gave a small, approving nod. “I’ve heard about you. Let’s make sure we win this thing.”</p>

    <p>With that, she turned and left the room, leaving Kaito standing there, still trying to process everything.</p>

    <p>Miyu nudged him playfully. “Looks like we’ve got some competition, huh?”</p>

    <p>Kaito sighed. “Yeah… no kidding.”</p>

    <p>But as the day wore on, a small part of him couldn’t help but feel a flicker of excitement. Maybe this quiz bee would be the perfect distraction from the chaos of his feelings for Hinami. And besides, working alongside Miyu and Rin meant one thing—he’d have to bring his A-game.</p>
