  <h2>Chapter 9: Afterwards</h2>

  <p>The day after the Battle of the Wits, Kaito sat alone on a bench in the school courtyard, staring out into the distance. The warm afternoon sun filtered through the trees, casting dappled shadows on the ground. Despite claiming third place, a weight still hung over him. His mind kept replaying the final moments of the quiz, thinking about how close they had come to second—and even first.</p>

  <p><em>Should I have been quicker? Was there something I missed?</em></p>

  <p>“You alright, Kaito?” Miyu’s voice snapped him back to reality. She slid into the seat beside him, her usual teasing smile softened with concern.</p>

  <p>“Yeah, I’m fine,” Kaito replied, rubbing the back of his neck. “It’s just… I thought we had it, you know? I really thought we were going to win.”</p>

  <p>Miyu patted his shoulder. “We still did great. Third out of thirty schools isn’t bad. Besides, you carried the team half the time.”</p>

  <p>Kaito chuckled. “You’re giving me too much credit. We worked together.”</p>

  <p>As he said that, his mind wandered back to the quiz, to those tense final moments when the pressure was suffocating. But that wasn’t the real issue. It was what had happened afterward.</p>

  <p>Just as the competition had ended, he’d seen her—Yumi. She had been standing near the exit, watching him. He hadn’t spoken to her, hadn’t even acknowledged her presence, but just the sight of her brought a flood of old memories. <em>Why was she there? What did she want?</em></p>

  <p>Miyu caught his distracted look. “You’re not still thinking about the quiz, are you?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>Kaito shook his head. “No… it’s something else.”</p>

  <p>Miyu crossed her arms, leaning in slightly, a teasing glint back in her eyes. “Is this about a certain someone from your past?”</p>

  <p>Kaito blinked, caught off guard. “How do you—”</p>

  <p>“I saw her too, Kaito,” Miyu said, her voice now more gentle. “Yumi, right? She was watching you the whole time.”</p>

  <p>Kaito frowned, unsure of what to say. “It’s been so long. I don’t even know what to think anymore.”</p>

  <p>Before the conversation could go any deeper, Ryo appeared, disrupting the mood with his usual carefree energy. “Hey, you guys! Everyone’s celebrating. Why are you sitting here, moping?”</p>

  <p>Miyu shot him a look. “Kaito’s just overthinking everything. What else is new?”</p>

  <p>Ryo grinned. “Classic Kaito.” He pulled up a chair, sitting backward on it. “Come on, man. You did awesome today. You should be proud. We’re all proud.”</p>

  <p>“I guess,” Kaito muttered, still distracted.</p>

  <p>“Guess?” Ryo repeated, shaking his head. “Man, this is your win too. You don’t see Miyu sulking.”</p>

  <p>Miyu smirked, giving Kaito a playful nudge. “Exactly. Ryo’s right. I’m not letting this drag me down, and neither should you.”</p>

  <p>The three of them headed to the canteen, where Rin was there—already seated, calmly going over her notes for the next exam. She was as unaffected by the noise around her as ever, her focus entirely on the next goal. When they sat down at the table, she didn’t even look up from her notes.</p>

  <p>“Already back to studying, Rin?” Miyu asked with an exaggerated sigh. “Didn’t the quiz fry your brain enough?”</p>

  <p>Rin finally glanced up, pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose. “There’s always another challenge ahead. I don’t see the point in resting when there’s more to prepare for.”</p>

  <p>Ryo whistled, impressed. “You never stop, do you?”</p>

  <p>Rin shrugged. “We’re already being considered for another prefecture-level competition. I’d rather be ready when it happens.”</p>

  <p>Kaito blinked. “Another competition? So soon?”</p>

  <p>“The head teacher mentioned it,” Rin replied, flipping a page in her notes. “Apparently, our performance at the Battle of the Wits caught their attention.”</p>

  <p>Miyu groaned, dropping her head onto the table dramatically. “Nooo, not more studying…”</p>

  <p>Ryo grinned. “Sounds like fun to me. You guys will show them what you're made of next time.”</p>

  <p>Kaito sat back, listening to their banter. He couldn’t help but feel a mix of pride and anticipation. Another competition meant more pressure, but it also meant another chance to prove themselves.</p>

  <p>Still, as much as he tried to stay in the moment, Yumi’s sudden appearance continued to weigh on him. Something about seeing her had unsettled him, and he wasn’t ready to deal with it.</p>

  <p>Before he could lose himself in thought again, Hinami approached the group, her warm smile making Kaito’s heart lift slightly. “Hey, everyone,” she greeted them, her voice gentle. “The teachers are wrapping things up. Are you all ready to head out?”</p>

  <p>Kaito nodded, feeling some of the tension ease. “Yeah, I’m ready.”</p>

  <p>As they stood up, Kaito’s gaze drifted toward the exit—and there she was again. Yumi, her eyes locked on him, still watching. She wasn’t smiling, just observing, and it sent a chill through him.</p>

  <p>He didn’t mention it. Not yet.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>As they made their way toward the exit, Kaito’s steps slowed when Yumi suddenly began walking toward them.</p>

  <p>“Kaito,” she called out, her voice cutting through the noise of the hallway. It was the first time she had spoken to him in over a year. He stopped, his friends pausing as they realized what was happening.</p>

  <p>Yumi closed the distance, her expression unreadable. “We need to talk.”</p>

  <p>And just like that, the memories Kaito had tried so hard to forget came rushing back. His heart raced, his body freezing in place, unsure of what to say.</p>

  <p>Hinami, standing beside him, glanced between the two, her soft smile fading as she sensed the tension. Miyu, always protective, took a step forward, but Kaito held up a hand to stop her. He wasn’t sure if he was ready for this confrontation, but he knew it was inevitable.</p>

  <p>“Let’s go,” he muttered to his friends, turning his back on Yumi without another word.</p>

  <p>But as they walked away, Kaito couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning of something far more complicated.</p>
