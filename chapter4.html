    <h2>Chapter 4: The Trip Begins</h2>
    <p>The morning air was crisp as Kaito boarded the bus with his group. They were heading to a research facility in a neighboring town, an exciting part of their ongoing project. The trip would be split over two days—today would be his turn with Hinami, and tomorrow, Ryo and Miyu would take over.</p>

    <p>As Kaito settled into his seat, he noticed Hinami approaching. She glanced around for a moment, and when she saw the empty seat beside him, she smiled and sat down next to him. "Looks like we're partners today," she said with a soft laugh, her voice carrying a hint of nervousness.</p>

    <p>"Yeah," Kaito replied, trying to sound casual despite the odd flutter in his chest. "Should be interesting."</p>

    <p>The bus rumbled to life, and soon they were on their way. Kaito couldn’t help but steal glances at Hinami as the town’s scenery slowly gave way to the countryside. She was quietly flipping through her notebook, reviewing notes for the day’s research. Kaito admired how focused she could be, but something about the quiet comfort of sitting next to her made him feel a little nervous.</p>

    <p>After a while, Hinami closed her notebook and turned to Kaito. “Do you think this trip will give us the data we need?”</p>

    <p>Kaito shrugged. “I hope so. I guess it depends on how well we manage our time there.”</p>

    <p>Hinami smiled softly. “Well, if we work like we’ve been doing so far, I think we’ll be fine.”</p>

    <p>Kaito chuckled. “Yeah, we make a good team.” He didn’t mean for it to sound anything more than an observation, but the way Hinami’s expression softened made him pause. For a second, their eyes met, and Kaito felt his pulse quicken. Something about this trip felt different—like the lines between work and something more were beginning to blur.</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>When they arrived at the research facility, Kaito and Hinami were given a tour of the laboratories. The space was vast and modern, filled with equipment that neither of them had seen before. Despite the seriousness of the work, there was an odd sense of excitement in the air.</p>

    <p>The pair spent the morning observing various experiments, taking notes on how the data was gathered and analyzed. Every now and then, Kaito would catch Hinami looking his way, and he found himself feeling more aware of her presence than ever before.</p>

    <p>At lunch, they found a small table outside where they could eat in the fresh air. The sunlight filtered through the trees, casting a soft glow over everything.</p>

    <p>Kaito opened his lunchbox, but before he could take a bite, Hinami spoke. “You’ve really been working hard on this project,” she said quietly. “It’s impressive.”</p>

    <p>Kaito blinked, surprised by the compliment. “Thanks, but you’ve been working just as hard. If anything, I’m just trying to keep up with you.”</p>

    <p>Hinami laughed softly, her cheeks flushing slightly. “You’re always so modest.”</p>

    <p>For a moment, they sat in comfortable silence, the gentle breeze brushing past them. Kaito’s mind raced. This felt different from their usual interactions—more personal, more meaningful. He wasn’t sure what it was, but sitting here with Hinami felt… right. Yet, he still couldn’t put his finger on what exactly had changed between them.</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>As the day progressed, the research tasks continued smoothly. Kaito and Hinami worked side by side, discussing their findings and sharing insights. But as the sun began to set and their day at the facility came to a close, Kaito found himself hesitant to leave.</p>

    <p>As they waited for the bus to pick them up, Kaito glanced at Hinami, who stood beside him, quietly watching the sunset. He hesitated for a moment before speaking. “Hinami, I—” He stopped, unsure of what he was even trying to say. Was he about to thank her? Compliment her? He didn’t know.</p>

    <p>Hinami turned to look at him, her eyes soft but questioning. “What is it?”</p>

    <p>Kaito opened his mouth, but no words came out. Instead, he just smiled awkwardly. “I… never mind. It’s nothing.”</p>

    <p>Hinami gave him a curious look but smiled back. “Okay.”</p>

    <p>The bus arrived shortly after, and as they sat together on the ride back, Kaito couldn’t help but think about how much closer he felt to her after today. Yet, despite everything, neither of them seemed to realize the feelings that were slowly growing between them.</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>The next day, it was Ryo and Miyu’s turn. The energy between them was completely different from Kaito and Hinami’s quiet comfort. From the moment they boarded the bus, Miyu was teasing Ryo, poking fun at his usual laid-back attitude.</p>

    <p>“You better not slack off today, Ryo. I don’t want to be stuck doing all the work,” Miyu teased, giving him a playful nudge.</p>

    <p>Ryo smirked, leaning back in his seat. “Relax, I’ve got this. You just worry about not getting too bossy.”</p>

    <p>Miyu rolled her eyes but smiled, her usual confidence hiding the slight fluster that only Ryo seemed to cause in her. As the bus rolled towards the research facility, they settled into an easy banter that neither could admit felt different from before.</p>

    <p>Throughout the day, Ryo found himself more aware of Miyu than usual. Her teasing and smug comments felt familiar, yet today, they carried an undertone that he hadn’t noticed before. He couldn’t help but watch her as she worked, admiring her focus and her knack for turning every task into a lighthearted challenge.</p>

    <p>At one point, they found themselves alone in one of the smaller labs, reviewing some of the equipment they’d been assigned to observe. Ryo leaned against the counter, watching Miyu closely.</p>

    <p>“You know,” he said, trying to sound nonchalant, “you’re kind of impressive when you’re not teasing me all the time.”</p>

    <p>Miyu looked up, surprised by the comment. She quickly covered it with a smirk. “Don’t get too used to it. I’ll always find a way to keep you on your toes.”</p>

    <p>Ryo chuckled, but something in the air had shifted. For the rest of the day, there was a subtle tension between them—a tension neither of them wanted to acknowledge just yet.</p>
