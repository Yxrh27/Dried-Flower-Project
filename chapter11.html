  <h2>Chapter 11: Unexpected Hangout</h2>

  <p>Kaito stood at the meeting spot, clutching his backpack, expecting only Hinami to show up for their project work. He had been preparing himself mentally to spend the afternoon with just the two of them, which both excited and made him a little nervous. The last few days had been full of small moments—those soft smiles, lingering glances, and quiet conversations—that had stirred something inside him.</p>

  <p>“Hey, Kaito!” Hinami's cheerful voice snapped him out of his thoughts.</p>

  <p>He turned to greet her, but just as he was about to speak, a loud, familiar voice cut in.</p>

  <p>“Yo! Guess who’s crashing your little study date?” Ryo waved wildly from behind Hinami, grinning like an idiot.</p>

  <p>Kaito blinked in surprise. “Wait, you're coming too?”</p>

  <p>“Of course!” Miyu popped up beside Ryo, her energy as high as ever. “Did you really think we’d let you two work on a project alone? Sounds boring!”</p>

  <p>Hinami smiled softly, not at all bothered. “I thought it would be fun to do it together. Besides, the more the merrier, right?”</p>

  <p>Kaito wasn’t sure whether to feel relieved or disappointed. He had been looking forward to some one-on-one time with Hinami, but hanging out with Ryo and Miyu always had its own chaotic charm.</p>

  <p>“We could all head to the library or…,” Kaito began.</p>

  <p>“Nah, too stuffy!” Miyu interrupted, slinging an arm around Kaito’s shoulders. “Let’s go to my place instead! We can hang out, have snacks, and pretend to work on the project!”</p>

  <p>Ryo chuckled. “I like the sound of that. Let’s pretend to be productive.”</p>

  <p>Kaito sighed but couldn’t help grinning. “Fine, let’s go.”</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Miyu’s house was exactly as Kaito expected—bright, loud, and full of random knick knacks that reflected her quirky personality. As soon as they stepped inside, Miyu ushered everyone into the living room, where a spread of snacks was already waiting.</p>

  <p>“Welcome to the Miyu Manor!” she declared dramatically. “Feel free to make yourselves at home… but don’t break anything. I’ll charge you!”</p>

  <p>Ryo immediately flopped onto the couch, grabbing a handful of chips. “I could get used to this.”</p>

  <p>Kaito sat down next to him, while Hinami settled across from them, looking relaxed and happy. She glanced at Kaito, her eyes sparkling with amusement. “So, what’s the plan for our ‘project’?”</p>

  <p>“Oh, right,” Miyu said with exaggerated seriousness, plopping down next to Hinami. “The project. We should totally get started on that… right after we discuss something important.”</p>

  <p>Kaito raised an eyebrow. “And what’s that?”</p>

  <p>Miyu leaned in closer to Hinami, a mischievous grin spreading across her face. “Hinami, tell us—what do you really think of Kaito?”</p>

  <p>Hinami’s eyes widened in surprise, and Kaito immediately felt his face heat up. “W-What?!”</p>

  <p>Ryo burst out laughing. “Oh man, this is gold.”</p>

  <p>Kaito covered his face with his hands, groaning. “Miyu, seriously?”</p>

  <p>But Miyu was relentless. She waved her hand dismissively at Kaito and turned back to Hinami. “Come on, Hinami! Spill the tea. What’s it like working with the Quiz Bee Hero?”</p>

  <p>Hinami’s cheeks flushed slightly, but she smiled good-naturedly. “Kaito’s really helpful, actually. He’s always focused, and he explains things really well.”</p>

  <p>Miyu gasped dramatically. “Helpful! Focused! Explains things! What a guy!”</p>

  <p>“Shut up, Miyu,” Kaito mumbled, sinking further into the couch.</p>

  <p>Hinami giggled, her laughter like music to Kaito’s ears. “It’s true! He’s really reliable.”</p>

  <p>Ryo elbowed Kaito. “You’re getting high praise, man. How does it feel?”</p>

  <p>“Like I want to disappear,” Kaito muttered.</p>

  <p>Miyu wasn’t done, though. She leaned even closer to Hinami, her voice dropping to a whisper (that was definitely still loud enough for everyone to hear). “But what about outside of school? Hmm? Do you think he’s, you know… cute?”</p>

  <p>Kaito nearly choked on his drink. “Miyu!”</p>

  <p>Ryo doubled over, laughing so hard he was practically in tears. Hinami, for her part, turned an even deeper shade of pink, though she didn’t seem offended. Instead, she glanced shyly at Kaito, her lips curving into a small smile.</p>

  <p>“I think Kaito’s… sweet,” she said softly.</p>

  <p>Kaito froze, his heart skipping a beat. Did she just say…?</p>

  <p>“Sweet!” Miyu repeated, clapping her hands together. “Aww, Kaito, you’re sweet! Like candy!”</p>

  <p>Ryo, gasping for air between laughs, managed to say, “Dude, you’ve been friend-zoned so hard.”</p>

  <p>Kaito covered his face again, wishing for a hole to open up in the floor and swallow him. “Please, stop…”</p>

  <hr>

  <p>As the afternoon went on, it became clear that no real work was going to get done. Instead, they spent the time lounging around, eating snacks, and talking about everything but their research project. At one point, Miyu and Ryo teamed up to try and beat Kaito in a random trivia game they found on Miyu’s phone.</p>

  <p>“No way! That answer was rigged!” Miyu protested after Kaito won for the third time in a row.</p>

  <p>“Face it, I’m unbeatable,” Kaito said smugly, enjoying his small victory after the earlier embarrassment.</p>

  <p>“You just wait,” Miyu threatened. “Next time, I’ll crush you!”</p>

  <p>Hinami, watching the whole exchange with a smile, leaned closer to Kaito. “You really are good at this kind of thing,” she whispered.</p>

  <p>Kaito’s heart did a little flip, and he glanced at her, catching the warmth in her eyes. “Thanks,” he replied, trying to keep his voice steady.</p>

  <p>The casual closeness between them was becoming more and more natural, and Kaito found himself enjoying every small moment. Every smile from Hinami, every time their hands brushed, made him feel lighter.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the room, Ryo leaned back on the couch, a mischievous glint in his eye as he observed Miyu fuming over her multiple losses. She crossed her arms, pouting slightly, clearly annoyed at Kaito's trivia prowess.</p>

  <p>“You really suck at this game,” Ryo teased, nudging her with his elbow.</p>

  <p>Miyu shot him a glare, puffing her cheeks. “Shut up! It’s rigged! How can anyone beat Kaito at trivia anyway? It’s like he’s a walking encyclopedia or something.”</p>

  <p>Ryo chuckled, leaning in a little closer. “Maybe you just need a better teammate. Someone who can carry you, you know?”</p>

  <p>Miyu’s eyes narrowed. “Are you saying I need help?”</p>

  <p>“Yup,” Ryo said with a smirk, “especially if you want to beat Kaito. You’re gonna need someone smart and dashing, like me.”</p>

  <p>Miyu rolled her eyes, but her lips twitched into a smile. “Oh, please. You? Smart and dashing?”</p>

  <p>“Don’t act like you’re not impressed,” Ryo quipped, flashing her a confident grin. He leaned back dramatically, placing his arm along the back of the couch, his fingers casually brushing against her shoulder. Miyu froze for a second, her eyes flickering toward Ryo’s hand but quickly composed herself, a sly grin creeping onto her face.</p>

  <p>“Impressed? Ha! You’ll have to do better than that, Mr. Dashing,” Miyu teased, flipping her hair dramatically. “But okay, hotshot. If you think you’re so great, let’s see if you can beat Kaito and me in a rematch.”</p>

  <p>Ryo leaned forward, locking eyes with her. “You’re on. But if we lose, you owe me a favor.”</p>

  <p>“A favor?” Miyu raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “What kind of favor?”</p>

  <p>“I’ll think of something later,” Ryo said, winking at her. “But don’t worry, you’ll like it.”</p>

  <p>Miyu’s cheeks flushed a little, and for the first time that afternoon, she didn’t have a snappy comeback. Instead, she looked away, trying to hide her flustered expression. “We’re totally winning this,” she muttered, more to herself than to Ryo.</p>

  <p>Ryo smirked, satisfied that he had finally caught her off guard. “We better. I’ve got high expectations now.”</p>

  <p>They exchanged one last glance before turning back to Kaito and Hinami, ready to dive into another round of trivia. But this time, the playful tension between Ryo and Miyu was undeniable—each teasing remark, every stolen glance, carrying a hint of something deeper.</p>

  <p>As the sun began to set, the room was filled with laughter, banter, and the unmistakable stirrings of young love—between Kaito and Hinami, as well as Ryo and Miyu.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>By the time the day ended, Miyu’s house was filled with the remains of snacks they had devoured and the sound of shared memories they’d created. They still hadn’t done any work on the project, but none of them seemed to care.</p>

  <p>Miyu stretched out on the couch, looking content. “Well, this was productive,” she said sarcastically. “We really got a lot done today.”</p>

  <p>Ryo snorted. “Yeah, we’re basically geniuses.”</p>

  <p>Hinami giggled. “We might have to actually do the project next time.”</p>

  <p>Kaito smiled at her. “Yeah… next time.”</p>

  <p>As they gathered their things to leave, Miyu nudged Kaito one last time. “Hey, don’t think I didn’t notice you two getting all cozy today. I’m just saying—this project might be more fun than we thought.”</p>

  <p>Kaito flushed again but couldn’t help but smile as he glanced at Hinami. Maybe Miyu wasn’t entirely wrong.</p>
