    <h2>Chapter 3: A Group of Four</h2>

    <p>The morning sunlight streamed into the classroom as Kaito settled into his seat. His thoughts were on the group research project that had been announced earlier that week. He wasn’t particularly anxious about it—after all, research was something he enjoyed. However, his curiosity had been piqued when the teacher revealed the groupings. He, Ryo, Miyu, and—most notably—Hinami Miyamoto had all been assigned to the same group.</p>

    <p>Kaito had been around Hinami for a while now, but this would be the first time they’d be working closely together on something significant. He wasn’t quite sure how to feel about it, but a part of him was looking forward to seeing how they’d collaborate.</p>

    <p>Ryo, ever the energetic one, plopped down next to him, his usual grin plastered on his face. “Can you believe it? We’re in the same group, man. This project might actually be fun.”</p>

    <p>Kaito chuckled. “Yeah, looks like the universe has a sense of humor.”</p>

    <p>Before he could say anything else, Hinami entered the room. She gave a small wave in Kaito’s direction, her shy smile, soft but genuine. Kaito felt a slight flutter in his chest at her presence, but he quickly shook it off as nerves. They were just classmates working on a project together—nothing more.</p>

    <p>“Good morning,” Hinami greeted them, taking the seat next to Kaito.</p>

    <p>“Morning, Hinami,” Kaito replied. He glanced at Ryo, who was trying (and failing) to hide his amused smirk.</p>

    <p>“So, what’s our plan?” Ryo asked, leaning back in his chair casually. “We’ve got a powerhouse group here. I say we go all out.”</p>

    <p>Before Kaito could respond, Miyu strode in, her usual playful confidence lighting up the room. “Alright, losers. Let’s get this show on the road,” she said, taking her seat with a dramatic flourish. She shot a teasing look at Kaito. “I hope you’re ready to pull your weight, Kaito. Don’t make me carry this project.”</p>

    <p>Kaito rolled his eyes but smirked. “Relax, Miyu. I’ll keep up.”</p>

    <p>“Good,” Miyu grinned, nudging him playfully. “It’s nice to know you’re taking this seriously.”</p>

    <p>With everyone gathered, the group quickly got to work. Kaito took the lead in organizing their tasks, his methodical nature coming into play as they divided the project into sections. Hinami was quiet but attentive, occasionally offering ideas that were insightful and well thought-out. Kaito found himself drawn to the way she approached things—calm, yet with a hidden depth.</p>

    <p>As they discussed the project, Kaito and Hinami often ended up next to each other, reviewing notes and brainstorming ideas. Their shoulders brushed occasionally, and each time, Kaito felt an odd sense of comfort being close to her. He chalked it up to the ease with which they communicated, but a small part of him wondered if there was something more.</p>

    <p>Hinami was equally at ease working with Kaito, though she wasn’t fully aware of the subtle changes in her own feelings. She admired how focused and driven he was, and their teamwork felt almost effortless. Yet, like Kaito, she didn’t dwell on the possibility that there might be more to their connection.</p>

    <p>Miyu, of course, noticed the developing dynamic and couldn’t resist teasing them. “You two are like a perfect duo,” she remarked at one point, her voice full of amusement. “I’ll bet you’re going to ace this project just because you’re so in sync.”</p>

    <p>Kaito flushed slightly but brushed it off. “We’re just working together,” he said, glancing at Hinami, who looked equally flustered.</p>

    <p>Ryo chuckled. “It’s true, though. You guys make a solid team.”</p>

    <p>The day wore on, and by the time they had wrapped up their initial meeting, the group had made good progress. As they packed up their things, Hinami turned to Kaito, her expression soft but sincere.</p>

    <p>“Thanks for your help today, Kaito. I think we’re off to a good start.”</p>

    <p>“Yeah, definitely,” Kaito replied, feeling a warmth spread through him at her words. “I’m glad we’re in the same group.”</p>

    <p>Hinami’s smile lingered a little longer this time before she turned to leave. Kaito found himself watching her go, a small part of him wondering why her presence left such an impression on him.</p>

    <p>As the group dispersed, Ryo gave Kaito a knowing look. “You two really clicked today, huh?”</p>

    <p>Kaito shrugged, trying to play it cool. “It’s just teamwork, that’s all.”</p>

    <p>But even as he said the words, Kaito couldn’t quite shake the feeling that working with Hinami had brought them closer in ways he hadn’t expected. And yet, neither of them seemed fully aware of the emotions slowly stirring between them.</p>

    <p>As the group meeting continued, their teacher entered the room with an important announcement.</p>

    <p>"Alright, class, listen up. For your research project, we’ve arranged a special trip to a research facility in the neighboring town. This will be a two-day excursion where you’ll get to observe real-world experiments and collect data to support your findings."</p>

    <p>The class buzzed with excitement at the news. Kaito exchanged glances with Ryo, who grinned widely. Miyu looked as smug as ever, while Hinami's expression was thoughtful, already thinking about how this trip could benefit their project.</p>

    <p>The teacher held up a hand to quiet the room. "Now, since the facility can’t accommodate everyone at once, we’re splitting the trip over two days. But instead of assigning groups myself, I’ll let you decide who goes on which day. Work with your groups to figure it out."</p>

    <p>Kaito looked at his group—Ryo, Miyu, and Hinami. The idea of splitting up for the trip made things feel more real, but also raised a dilemma. He didn’t want to leave it up to chance who would go with whom, and clearly, neither did anyone else.</p>

    <p>Miyu leaned back in her chair, smirking as she crossed her arms. “Well, I don’t mind going on either day. What do you guys think?”</p>

    <p>Ryo stretched lazily. “Same here. I’m good with anything.”</p>

    <p>Kaito, feeling the tension building in the air, glanced at Hinami, who was quiet as she considered. Before anyone could say more, Kaito spoke up. “How about we split it so there’s a good balance on both days? Maybe two of us go on Day 1, and two go on Day 2.”</p>

    <p>Hinami nodded thoughtfully. “That makes sense. Since we’ve been working closely, it might be better if we alternate, so the group can cover more ground.”</p>

    <p>Miyu shot Kaito a teasing look. “Sounds like you’re volunteering to go on Day 1, huh?”</p>

    <p>Kaito hesitated, unsure if he should push for it. But then, before he could speak, Hinami quietly added, “I don’t mind going on Day 1 too, if that’s okay with everyone.”</p>

    <p>Kaito’s heart skipped a beat. He tried to keep his tone casual. “Yeah, that works for me.”</p>

    <p>Ryo, grinning as if he saw through them, shrugged. “Guess Miyu and I will take Day 2, then.”</p>

    <p>Miyu raised an eyebrow, casting a playful glance between Kaito and Hinami. “Day 1 is going to be interesting, I see.”</p>

    <p>Kaito rolled his eyes but smirked. “Don’t make it weird, Miyu.”</p>

    <p>As the group finalized their decision, Kaito couldn’t help but feel a mix of nervous excitement. The thought of spending a whole day working alongside Hinami, away from the usual classroom setting, made him wonder if this trip might bring them closer in ways he hadn’t yet imagined.</p>
