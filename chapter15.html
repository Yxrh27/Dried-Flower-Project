<h2>Chapter 15: Miyu’s Reflection</h2>

<p>A week had passed since Valentine’s Day, and the familiar rhythm of school life settled back into place. The courtyard buzzed with activity, laughter, and chatter as students drifted between classes. Beneath the shade of a quiet tree, Kaito and Miyu sat side by side, enjoying a rare moment of peace amidst the day’s rush. Miyu had been turning over a question in her mind for days, and now, as she glanced at Kaito scrolling through his phone, she felt the urge to bring it up.</p>

<p>With a gentle nudge, she grinned. “Hey, Kaito. Got a minute?”</p>

<p>He looked up, surprised but curious, tucking his phone away. “For you? Always. What’s up?”</p>

<p>She hesitated, her fingers tracing absent patterns in the dirt as she carefully chose her words. “Let’s say… just hypothetically, you found out that your best friend liked you. How would you handle it?”</p>

<p>Kaito’s eyes sparkled with intrigue. “Oh, hypothetical, huh?” His lips switched into a smirk, sensing the playful seriousness in her voice. “Are we talking about Ryo?”</p>

<p>“What—no!” Miyu quickly denied, cheeks warming. She laughed, a bit flustered. “It’s just a hypothetical, okay? Work with me here.”</p>

<p>“Alright, alright, I’m serious now.” Kaito leaned back, folding his arms thoughtfully. “If it were me… I’d probably talk to them. Try to understand where they’re coming from and see if I feel the same way. Sure, it’d be awkward, but… if it’s worth it, why not?”</p>

<p>Miyu looked down, brow furrowed in thought. “But what if you’re not sure? Like, what if you’re only interested because you’re so close to them?”</p>

<p>Kaito’s gaze softened, catching the vulnerability in her tone. “I get that. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference. But I think… eventually, you just know. Even if it’s not clear at first, you start to feel it in a way that sticks with you.” He gave a little shrug. “If you feel that, maybe it’s worth a chance.”</p>

<p>Miyu sighed, a mix of relief and apprehension flooding her expression. “And what if that person… you know, is just their usual, teasing self, and you have no idea if they’re being serious?”</p>

<p>Kaito laughed lightly. “Isn’t that Ryo’s specialty? He’s like that with everyone, but especially with you. If he’s making more of an effort with you, though, maybe he’s hoping you’ll notice.”</p>

<p>A thoughtful silence settled over her. “It’s not that simple, Kaito. He’s… well, he’s fun, and he’s always joking around. I just… I don’t know. What if I mess it all up?”</p>

<p>Kaito nodded, understanding her hesitation. “Then take it slow. Let things happen naturally. Sometimes the best moments are the ones you don’t see coming.”</p>

<p>Miyu managed a small smile. “You’re probably right. I just don’t want to ruin our friendship, you know?”</p>

<p>Kaito offered a reassuring smile, giving her hand a light pat. “If it’s real, the friendship will survive, maybe even grow stronger. Just be yourself.”</p>

<p>They fell into a comfortable silence, each lost in their thoughts. Kaito’s gaze drifted toward the busy courtyard, scanning the crowd until he spotted Hinami. She was standing with her friends, laughing and chatting, but there was something subdued about her—a quiet, distant look in her eyes. When she glanced his way, their eyes met briefly before she quickly looked away, and he felt a strange pang in his chest.</p>

<p>Miyu noticed his expression shift and nudged him. “Hey, what’s up with you? You’ve been kind of… off lately.”</p>

<p>He gave her a half-hearted smile, running a hand through his hair. “It’s Hinami. She seems… I don’t know, distant. Like she’s going through something, but she won’t talk about it.”</p>

<p>Miyu considered his words, her face softening with understanding. “Maybe she just needs some time to open up. Sometimes people don’t want to talk about things, especially if they’re personal.”</p>

<p>Kaito let out a quiet sigh, frustration flickering in his eyes. “I just… I wish I could understand what’s going on with her. I feel like there’s something I should be doing.”</p>

<p>Miyu gave his arm a gentle squeeze. “Maybe the best thing you can do is just be there. Sometimes, that’s all people need.”</p>

<p>Kaito nodded slowly, though his gaze lingered on Hinami’s retreating figure. “Yeah, maybe.”</p>

<p>The bell rang, signaling the end of their break. As they got up, Miyu shot him a bright smile, hoping to lighten his mood. “Come on, Mr. Relationship Expert. Let’s get back to class before the teachers decide to give us another lecture.”</p>

<p>He chuckled, pushing his worries aside as they made their way back to the classroom, Miyu’s easy-going laughter making him feel a little lighter. For a moment, he forgot about the distance with Hinami, and his steps felt just a bit more carefree.</p>

<p>The rest of the day passed in a blur of classes and assignments, but Kaito found his thoughts wandering back to Hinami now and then. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something between them was changing, and he didn’t know if he was ready for it. And as he left school with Miyu and Ryo that afternoon, he felt that unease settling deeper, lingering even as they joked and laughed on their way home.</p>

<p>Later that evening, as Miyu lay in bed, she replayed her conversation with Kaito, his words echoing in her mind. She held the small keychain Ryo had given her, twirling it between her fingers as she thought about the moments they’d shared. Despite her fears, a warmth bloomed in her chest, and she couldn’t help but smile as a new certainty took root in her heart. Maybe… just maybe, it was worth taking a chance.</p>
