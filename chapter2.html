    <h2>Chapter 2: Old Stem, New Flowers</h2>

    <p>The sun dipped low in the sky as the final bell rang, signaling the end of another school day at Seiryu High. Students flooded the hallways, eager to head home or meet up with friends. Kaito was among them, strolling toward the school gates with his bag slung over one shoulder. He had been thinking about his recent conversation with Hinami, and though his thoughts were deep, he couldn’t help but look forward to hanging out with his friends.</p>

    <p>As he approached the gates, a familiar figure was already there, waiting with a lazy grin. It was Ryo Nakamura, his closest friend and the most laid-back guy Kaito knew.</p>

    <p>“Kaito! Took you long enough,” Ryo called out, pushing off the wall he’d been leaning on. “Thought you were going to leave me hanging.”</p>

    <p>Kaito chuckled. “Sorry, Ryo. Just got caught up in my thoughts.”</p>

    <p>Ryo smirked. “Still thinking about that ‘just a friend’ of yours? Gonna have to meet this girl one day to see what she’s really like.”</p>

    <p>Kaito rolled his eyes but couldn’t help smiling. “Maybe. Where’s Haruki and Kenji?”</p>

    <p>As if on cue, Haruki Suzuki and Kenji Takahashi rounded the corner, both chatting animatedly. Haruki, the group’s self-proclaimed comedian, was mid-laugh, probably at one of his own jokes, while Kenji, the level-headed one, simply shook his head in mild exasperation.</p>

    <p>“There you guys are,” Haruki said, clapping Kaito on the shoulder. “We were just talking about how Kenji’s probably the only one of us who doesn’t act like a total idiot sometimes.”</p>

    <p>Kenji adjusted his glasses, looking at Haruki with a raised eyebrow. “And yet, somehow, I’m still your friend.”</p>

    <p>“Because you love us, right?” Haruki grinned, causing Ryo and Kaito to laugh.</p>

    <p>They were debating whether to hit up their favorite arcade or try out the new ramen shop that had opened near the station when Kaito’s attention was caught by a girl sitting on a bench, reading a book.</p>

    <p>He did a double take, recognizing the chestnut-brown hair and familiar features.</p>

    <p>“Miyu?” he called out, stopping in his tracks.</p>

    <p>The girl looked up, her eyes widening in surprise before a warm smile spread across her face. “Kaito! It’s been so long!”</p>

    <p>The rest of the group paused, curiosity piqued. Kaito walked over to the bench, and the girl—Miyu Hayashi—stood up to greet him.</p>

    <p>Miyu had been Kaito’s best friend during seventh grade. They had been inseparable back then, sharing everything from homework troubles to their dreams for the future. But after they went to different high schools, they had lost touch.</p>

    <p>“Nice to see you too,” Kaito replied playfully. “What are you doing here?”</p>

    <p>“I just transferred to Seiryu High,” Miyu said, her grin widening. “Looks like you’re stuck with me again.”</p>

    <p>Kaito laughed. “Can’t say I’m surprised. These are my friends—Ryo, Haruki, and Kenji.”</p>

    <p>Miyu nodded politely, but her gaze quickly returned to Kaito. “So, you’ve actually made friends without me around? I’m impressed.”</p>

    <p>Ryo stepped in, grinning. “So, you and Kaito go way back, huh? Must have some good stories.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, plenty,” Miyu smirked. “I could tell you about the time Kaito got lost in the park and—”</p>

    <p>“Okay, okay, enough of that,” Kaito cut in, blushing. “We’re going to get ramen. You coming?”</p>

    <p>“Of course. I wouldn’t miss it.”</p>

    <p>As they walked to the ramen shop, Kaito felt a sense of nostalgia. It was like old times, but with a new twist.</p>

    <p>When they arrived, Haruki kept the mood light with his jokes, Kenji offered dry remarks, and Ryo—much to Kaito’s surprise—seemed particularly interested in Miyu. He asked her about her hobbies, her old school, and how she was finding Seiryu so far.</p>

    <p>Miyu continued to tease Kaito. “Any girlfriends I should know about? Or are you still as clueless as ever?”</p>

    <p>Kaito groaned. “Miyu, I swear, you never change.”</p>

    <p>Ryo leaned in. “So, you two were close back in middle school?”</p>

    <p>“Close?” Miyu echoed. “Kaito couldn’t survive a day without me. I was practically his older sister.”</p>

    <p>“You’re only a month older than me.”</p>

    <p>“And yet, I'm so much smarter,” Miyu quipped, making everyone laugh.</p>

    <p>Later, Miyu walked beside Kaito again. “It’s really great to see you again, Kaito. I’ve missed hanging out like this.”</p>

    <p>“Same here,” Kaito said sincerely. “Feels like old times.”</p>

    <p>Just before parting ways, Miyu said, “There’s this girl in my class, Hinami. She’s been really nice to me. Do you know her?”</p>

    <p>“Yeah, I know Hinami. We’ve been hanging out lately,” Kaito replied.</p>

    <p>Miyu’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “Hanging out, huh? I’ll have to meet her and see if she’s good enough for my little Kaito.”</p>

    <p>“She’s a friend, Miyu.”</p>

    <p>“Uh-huh,” Miyu said, clearly unconvinced. “Well, maybe we can all hang out sometime.”</p>

    <p>“I’d like that.”</p>

    <p>As they said their goodbyes, Kaito felt comforted by Miyu’s return. But when he glanced at Ryo—who was unusually quiet and thoughtful—he couldn’t shake the feeling that things were about to get even more interesting.</p>
