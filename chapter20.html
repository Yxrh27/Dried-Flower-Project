<h2>Chapter 20: Dried Flower</h2>

<p>The warmth of spring filled the air as the school year drew to a close. Laughter and excited chatter echoed through the halls, an energy that seemed to carry everyone forward into the summer. For Kaito, though, the end of the year felt bittersweet. With exams and projects now behind him, he couldn’t ignore the quiet absence that had lingered ever since he and Hinami had started drifting apart. Each day felt like a collection of moments slipping away, yet he found himself holding onto each one, unwilling to let go.</p>

<p>The school’s completion ceremony filled the gymnasium with students, teachers, and families. Rows of seats stretched back to the walls, and a stage had been set up in front, decorated with flowers and banners in celebration of another year’s close.</p>

<p>The auditorium buzzed with a mix of chatter and laughter as the tenth-grade students gathered in their formal uniforms, ready for the completion ceremony. Kaito adjusted his blazer, his thoughts drifting as he scanned the growing crowd.</p>

<p>“Kaito! Over here!” Miyu’s familiar voice broke his reverie. She was standing near the stage with Ryo, both waving him over.</p>

<p>“You took your time,” Ryo teased as Kaito walked up to them. “What’s the matter? Nervous about walking across the stage?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” Kaito replied, smirking. “You, on the other hand, should be. I remember you tripped during rehearsals.”</p>

<p>“Hey! That was one time!” Ryo protested, earning a giggle from Miyu.</p>

<p>Miyu chimed in, “Don’t tease him too much, Kaito. He’s already sweating buckets just thinking about it.”</p>

<p>“Am not!” Ryo shot back, though he pulled at his collar self-consciously.</p>

<p>As they joked, Rin joined the group, her calm presence balancing the lively banter. “You three never change,” she said, shaking her head but smiling.</p>

<p>“Why would we? It’s part of our charm,” Ryo replied with a grin.</p>

<p>Kaito chuckled. “Glad you think so. I’m just surprised you managed to survive the year without Rin strangling you.”</p>

<p>Rin rolled her eyes but softened as she looked at Kaito. “You’ve been pretty quiet lately. Everything okay?”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Kaito said, his voice steady but distant. “Just thinking about how far we’ve come.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go getting all serious on us now,” Miyu teased, nudging him. “We’ve got a big day ahead, so save the deep thoughts for later.”</p>

<p>“Kaito! Ryo! What’s up?” Haruki’s loud voice cut through as he approached with Kenji in tow, both grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p>“Perfect timing,” Ryo said. “Just when I thought things couldn’t get noisier, here comes Haruki.”</p>

<p>“Hey, don’t act like you’re not thrilled to see me,” Haruki shot back, clapping Ryo on the shoulder. “And I see Rin’s still keeping you all in check.”</p>

<p>Rin smirked. “Someone has to.”</p>

<p>Kenji adjusted his glasses and looked at Kaito. “How are you holding up? You look like you’ve got something on your mind.”</p>

<p>Kaito gave a half-smile. “Just the usual. You know how it is.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be fine. Let’s get through this ceremony first, then we can talk about what comes next,” Kenji said reassuringly.</p>

<hr>

<p>Kaito stood among his classmates, the ceremonial music echoing through the hall. He gripped the edge of his certificate tightly, the weight of the paper grounding him in the present. Yet, his mind drifted to the past year—a whirlwind of emotions, challenges, and fleeting moments of joy.</p>

<p>As the names were called, his heart skipped when the familiar voice of their teacher announced, “Hinami Miyamoto.”</p>

<p>Kaito turned instinctively, catching sight of her as she walked up the stage. Her long hair swayed gently as she bowed to the applause, her smile faint but radiant.</p>

<p><em>She came,</em> he realized, the thought stirring a bittersweet mix of emotions.</p>

<p>When the ceremony ended, he found himself scanning the crowd. Amid the sea of faces, his eyes met hers. Hinami hesitated for a moment, then offered a small wave before blending into the crowd.</p>

<p>As Kaito listened to names being called one by one, his mind filled with memories of the past year—quiet study sessions in the library, late-night conversations, small moments shared that had felt like they would last forever. He knew they were only memories now, yet they held a warmth that wouldn’t fade easily.</p>

<p>When his own name echoed through the gym, he rose and walked toward the stage to accept his certificate, hearing the applause but feeling distant from it all. The moment felt surreal, like he was walking through a memory already. He accepted the diploma with a small nod and handshake, then returned to his seat, each step heavy with the unspoken goodbyes that had begun to fill the space between him and Hinami.</p>

<hr>

<p>In her quiet room that evening, Hinami sat alone at her desk, the golden glow of her bedside lamp casting soft shadows. She held dried flowers in her hands, the blue, pink, and purple hues faded to muted shades. It had been a gift from Kaito, one she’d kept with a silent hope she hadn’t known she held onto.</p>

<p>As her fingers traced over the delicate petals, she felt a pang of nostalgia. She remembered the day he had given her the flowers—Valentine’s Day, when the winter chill had softened just enough to hint at the spring that was to come. She hadn’t thought much of the gesture at the time, but now, as she looked at the flowers, she felt a weight settle in her heart. They represented something fragile yet beautiful, something that had grown in the quiet spaces they had shared.</p>

<p>She let her eyes linger on the dried petals, the colors softening with age, as if mirroring the emotions she had kept hidden. Her heart ached with the knowledge that she hadn’t been ready, that she had held back from something she might never find again. A bittersweet smile touched her lips as she carefully placed the flowers back on the vase, knowing that some things would always remain a part of her, even as life moved forward.</p>

<hr>

<p>After the ceremony, students gathered outside, laughing, taking pictures, and exchanging messages in yearbooks. Ryo and Miyu found Kaito, their excitement drawing him out of his quiet thoughts. They nudged him playfully, teasing him about his somber expression.</p>

<p>“Come on, it’s the end of the school year! Lighten up a bit, Kaito!” Miyu grinned, playfully smacking his shoulder.</p>

<p>Kaito forced a small smile, though he couldn’t shake the bittersweet feeling. “Guess I’m just… taking it all in,” he said, his voice quieter than usual.</p>

<p>Ryo gave him a knowing look, clapping a hand on his shoulder. “We’re gonna be seniors next year. This is just the beginning.”</p>

<p>They stood together, sharing plans for the summer, yet Kaito’s gaze drifted back to the crowd, searching for Hinami one last time. He caught a glimpse of her as she slipped away from the others, walking toward the quiet path that led to a small park near the school. Without thinking, he followed, a silent urge pulling him toward the memories they had left behind.</p>

<hr>

<p>He found himself at the familiar park bench where they’d spent countless afternoons together. The soft light of early evening filtered through the trees, casting gentle shadows on the ground. He took a seat, letting the quiet settle around him, and his thoughts drifted to the moments they had shared here—the laughter, the shy glances, the small touches that had once meant so much.</p>

<p>His mind replayed the day he’d given her the flowers, a gesture that had felt so significant in its simplicity. He wondered if she still remembered it, if she kept them somewhere, even as time faded the petals and softened the colors. Yet he knew, in his heart, that whatever memories she held, they were hers alone now. He would never truly know how she had felt or what she had carried with her.</p>

<p>Footsteps brought him out of his thoughts, and he looked up to see Hinami standing a short distance away, her expression unreadable. They were both quiet, and for a long moment, neither spoke. She took a slow breath and stepped closer, stopping just a few feet away.</p>

<p>She looked the same, yet different. Her eyes held a quiet sadness, but her smile was warm—almost apologetic.</p>

<p>“You stayed,” Kaito said softly as she approached.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Hinami replied, her voice gentle. “I wouldn’t miss it.”</p>

<p>They stood in silence, the noise of the crowd fading into the background. Kaito finally spoke, his voice hesitant. “Do you regret... us?”</p>

<p>Hinami shook her head. “No. Never. You made me feel alive, Kaito. But... I wasn’t ready to love you the way you deserved.”</p>

<p>Her words were a dagger wrapped in velvet. Kaito nodded, swallowing the lump in his throat. “I understand.”</p>

<p>“I’ll always cherish what we had,” she continued, her voice breaking. “But I need to find myself before I can truly give my heart to anyone.”</p>

<p>Kaito turned to her, searching her face. He wanted to argue, to tell her they could face anything together, but deep down, he knew she was right.</p>

<p>“Take care of yourself, Hinami,” he said finally, his voice steady despite the tears threatening to spill.</p>

<p>They shared a final look, each of them knowing that this was goodbye, even if they never said it aloud. The breeze stirred, carrying with it the scent of spring, as if nature itself was offering them a quiet farewell. She took a step back, her hand lifting slightly as though to wave, but she hesitated and let it fall to her side.</p>

<p>“Take care, Kaito,” she whispered, her voice almost lost in the fading light.</p>

<p>She turned and walked away, her figure disappearing along the path until she was just a memory, a part of the year that was ending. Kaito sat there a while longer, letting the quiet fill the spaces she had left behind. When he finally rose to leave, he felt a strange peace, as if he had taken the first step towards letting go.</p>

<hr>

<p>Kaito found Ryo and Miyu waiting for him near the school gates.</p>

<p>“You look like you’ve been hit by a truck,” Ryo teased, slinging an arm around Kaito’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Subtle as always, Ryo,” Miyu said, rolling her eyes. She handed Kaito a canned coffee. “Here. You look like you need it.”</p>

<p>Kaito chuckled softly, the warmth of their presence cutting through his melancholy. “Thanks, guys.”</p>

<p>Miyu leaned closer, her expression softening. “You know, you’ll be okay. It’ll hurt for a while, but one day, it won’t hurt as much.”</p>

<p>Ryo nodded. “And when that day comes, we’ll still be here, annoying you.”</p>

<p>Kaito smiled despite himself. “You two are the worst... but I appreciate it.”</p>

<p>Ryo gave him a thumbs-up. “Next year, we’ll take on the world together as seniors.”</p>

<hr>

<p>As the evening sun dipped below the horizon, Kaito stood alone in his room, gazing at a small photograph on his desk—a candid shot of him and Hinami laughing during the research trip.</p>

<p>He placed it face down and turned to the window, watching the world outside.</p>

<p><em>Maybe someday, life will bring us back together.</em></p>

<p>But for now, he would move forward, carrying the lessons and memories with him.</p>

<p>The dried flowers on Hinami’s vase stood quietly, their petals fragile but intact—much like the love they once shared.</p>
