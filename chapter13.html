  <h2>Chapter 13: A Quiet Connection</h2>

<p>A week had passed since the quiz bee, and the lingering energy of the event had given way to quieter, everyday moments. To unwind from the usual rhythm of school life, the gang had arranged to meet at their favorite spot—a cozy, tucked-away café hidden in a quieter part of town. The café had practically become their own sanctuary, a small world where time slowed down, and they could laugh, talk, and just be themselves. Its warm lighting and rustic decor created a calm, intimate space that made it easy to forget about exams, schoolwork, or even the occasional worries that crept into their lives.</p>

<p>As the group settled around the table, a familiar warmth filled the air, punctuated by Miyu’s enthusiastic storytelling. She was already halfway through recounting a ridiculous moment from class, her voice rising and falling with animated gestures that made the others laugh. Ryo listened with his usual amused smirk, occasionally interrupting to add his own teasing comments. Kaito leaned back in his chair, enjoying the energy but letting his gaze drift across the table to where Hinami sat, her fingers wrapped around her cup. She laughed along with them, joining in on the conversation here and there, but something felt slightly… different.</p>

<p>Hinami’s smile was soft, as always, but her gaze seemed distant. Though she laughed at Miyu’s story, there was a certain softness in her eyes that didn’t quite reach him. Kaito couldn’t shake the feeling that she was somewhere else entirely, her mind caught in thoughts she wasn’t sharing with the group. She would look down at her drink, her fingers idly stirring, as if lost in a place just beyond reach.</p>

<p>“Hey, Kaito!” Ryo’s voice pulled him back to the present with a nudge. “What’s with the spaced-out look? Already stressing about next week’s exams?”</p>

<p>Kaito blinked, realizing he’d been staring off, and chuckled lightly. “Maybe I’m just distracted.”</p>

<p>Miyu rolled her eyes, nudging him playfully. “Typical Kaito. Always overthinking things. You really need to loosen up sometimes!”</p>

<p>“Oh yeah?” Kaito shot back with a grin. “And I guess you’re the most knowledgeable on relaxing, Miss Science Expert?”</p>

<p>Miyu pretended to look offended, but her eyes sparkled. “Hey, someone’s got to keep an eye on you, Mr. Bookworm! You’d probably forget what fun is without me around.”</p>

<p>Ryo chuckled at the banter, then glanced over at Miyu with a look that softened the smirk on his face. Leaning slightly closer, he murmured, “Maybe you could teach him a few things about unwinding.”</p>

<p>Miyu blinked, her cheeks flushing slightly, but she brushed it off with a laugh. “Please, Ryo. Like you’d be any better at handling stress if you were in his shoes!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that,” Ryo replied with a playful shrug. He leaned just close enough that Miyu’s cheeks flushed a little deeper, catching her off guard. “I think you might be the one who needs a lesson in relaxing, too.”</p>

<p>She rolled her eyes, brushing a lock of hair behind her ear, but her heart skipped a beat. “Whatever, Ryo,” she muttered, trying to sound dismissive, though the faint smile on her lips betrayed her.</p>

<p>Kaito noticed the moment, raising an eyebrow with a smirk. “What’s this? Are you two hiding something from us?”</p>

<p>Ryo kept his gaze on Miyu, his smirk transforming into something more genuine. “Hide? Me? Never. Right, Miyu?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, sure,” she laughed, though her cheeks were still pink, and Kaito chuckled. The moment of lighthearted teasing reminded him of the easy connection they all shared.</p>

<p>As he glanced over at Hinami, though, he noticed her fingers absently stirring her drink again. Her gaze was distant, lost in thought, and she hadn’t reacted to the banter around her. The warm café lights reflected softly in her eyes, adding a gentle glow, but something about her seemed unusually fragile, like she was holding something close to her heart that she couldn’t quite share.</p>

<p>“Hinami?” he asked gently, keeping his voice low so as not to startle her.</p>

<p>She looked up, a hint of surprise flashing in her eyes before she offered him a small, slightly apologetic smile. “Oh, sorry… I spaced out a bit.”</p>

<p>Kaito’s concern deepened, though he kept his tone casual. “Everything okay?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, of course,” she replied with a quick nod, her smile returning but not quite reaching her eyes. “I was just… thinking, I guess.”</p>

<p>Ryo, who’d been watching Miyu with a thoughtful expression, suddenly cleared his throat, breaking the moment. “Hey, Miyu. Walk with me for a bit?” he asked, glancing outside where the evening sky had taken on shades of dusk.</p>

<p>Miyu blinked, clearly surprised, but nodded. “Uh, sure?” She looked at the others and shrugged. “We’ll be back in a bit.”</p>

<p>As Ryo and Miyu stepped outside, the soft evening air wrapped around them, bringing a slight chill but also a sense of calm. They wandered down the quiet street, letting the silence stretch out comfortably until Ryo finally turned to her with a mischievous grin. “So,” he said with a hint of playfulness, “I think you’re starting to like me, huh?”</p>

<p>Miyu let out a startled laugh, her cheeks pink. “Wha—where did you get that idea?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on,” Ryo teased, nudging her shoulder. “You can’t tell me you haven’t thought about it.”</p>

<p>She laughed again, looking away to hide the smile tugging at her lips. “You’re really full of yourself, you know that?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Ryo shrugged, his grin widening. “But I’m also right. Admit it, Miyu.”</p>

<p>She huffed, crossing her arms with an exaggerated roll of her eyes. “In your dreams, Ryo.”</p>

<p>But even as she protested, the banter faded into a comfortable silence. After a moment, Ryo reached into his pocket, pulling out a small, simple keychain. He’d seen it in a shop earlier that day and, on impulse, thought of her. Without another word, he held it out to her, his usual confident expression softened.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said, his tone sincere. “It’s nothing fancy, but… it made me think of you.”</p>

<p>Miyu looked at him in surprise, then down at the keychain—a simple charm, but somehow it felt special in her hand. Her fingers brushed against his as she took it, and she looked up, her expression softened by a shy smile. “Thanks, Ryo,” she said, her voice quiet. “I’ll keep it.”</p>

<p>Ryo’s gaze lingered on her, his usual teasing smile replaced with a rare warmth. “Good,” he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. In that moment, there was an understanding between them, a gentle spark of something that didn’t need words.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in the café, Kaito and Hinami sat alone. The gentle hum of quiet conversations filled the space around them, but they both remained silent, each caught in their own thoughts. Kaito felt the familiar warmth of Hinami’s presence beside him, but that sense of distance lingered, like a whisper just out of reach. He wanted to reach out, to bridge that gap, but he held back, sensing that there was something Hinami needed to hold onto herself.</p>

<p>The silence between them wasn’t uncomfortable; it was simply… there, a quiet connection that didn’t need to be filled with words. As they sat, Kaito found himself wondering what Hinami was thinking, why she seemed to be somewhere far away. And though he couldn’t quite grasp it, he felt that whatever it was, it was something he couldn’t force her to share.</p>

<p>The others returned after a few minutes, laughter in their voices as they rejoined the group. But as they all said their goodbyes and drifted in separate directions, Kaito’s mind stayed on that fleeting expression in Hinami’s eyes, a softness that left him with a feeling he couldn’t quite name. And as he walked home alone, he felt as though something between them was slowly, imperceptibly slipping away—like sand falling through his fingers.</p>
