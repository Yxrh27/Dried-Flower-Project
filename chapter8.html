  <h2>Chapter 8: The Battle of Wits</h2>

  <p>The field was buzzing with excitement as students from all over the prefecture filled the seats, each wearing their school’s colors. Banners hung from the ceiling, and the stage was set with desks arranged in neat rows, each labeled with the names of the 30 competing schools. A large digital scoreboard loomed overhead, its bright lights displaying the words: "The Battle of Wits 2022" in bold, flashing letters.</p>

  <p>Kaito stood, his heart pounding in his chest as he looked out over the sea of faces. The scale of the event was far larger than he’d anticipated, and the pressure was starting to get to him. He tugged at the collar of his uniform, feeling the heat of the stage lights already, even though the competition hadn’t started yet.</p>

  <p>Miyu, standing beside him, nudged him with her elbow. “Hey, you’re not chickening out on me, are you?” She gave him a teasing grin, but there was a hint of nervousness in her eyes too.</p>

  <p>Kaito forced a smile, shaking his head. “I’m fine. Just didn’t expect it to be this...big.”</p>

  <p>Rin, their third teammate, adjusted her glasses and glanced at the crowd with a calculating gaze. “It’s a standard competition. The scale doesn’t change the questions, just the stakes.”</p>

  <p>Kaito raised an eyebrow. “Easy for you to say. You’re the most prepared out of all of us.”</p>

  <p>Before Rin could respond, a familiar voice broke through the tension. “Well, well, look who’s competing this year.”</p>

  <p>Kaito turned and blinked in surprise as a girl with short, dark hair and sharp eyes approached them, a confident smirk on her face. She wore the uniform of a rival school, and her presence immediately stirred memories from years ago.</p>

  <p>“Kei?” Kaito said, incredulous. “I didn’t know you’d be competing.”</p>

  <p>Kei shrugged, her smirk widening. “I could say the same about you. Haven’t seen you since middle school.” She turned her gaze to Miyu and grinned. “And Miyu, still sticking close to Kaito, I see.”</p>

  <p>Miyu crossed her arms, giving Kei a smug look. “Can’t shake me that easily.”</p>

  <p>Kaito chuckled, but the sight of Kei brought a new wave of anxiety. Kei had always been one of the smartest students back in middle school, and it seemed that hadn’t changed. Now she was on the opposing side, representing one of the top schools in the region.</p>

  <p>Rin, however, seemed unfazed by Kei’s presence. “She’s just another competitor,” she said calmly. “Focus on what we’ve prepared for.”</p>

  <p>Kei raised an eyebrow at Rin, clearly impressed by her composed demeanor. “Confident, aren’t you? I like that. But don’t get too comfortable. My team’s been training hard for this.”</p>

  <p>With that, Kei gave them one last playful smirk before walking back to her team.</p>

  <p>Kaito exhaled slowly, feeling the weight of the competition settle in. This wasn’t just about doing well—it was about proving himself against someone from his past, someone who had always been just a little bit ahead of him.</p>

  <p>“Hey,” Miyu said quietly, noticing his expression. “Don’t let her get in your head. We’ve got this.”</p>

  <p>Kaito nodded, though his mind was still racing. “Yeah, I know. Let’s just do our best.”</p>

  <hr>

  <p>As the quiz bee began, the atmosphere in the auditorium shifted. The lights dimmed slightly, and a spotlight shone on the stage as the announcer’s voice boomed over the microphone.</p>

  <p>“Welcome to The Battle of Wits 2022! Today, 30 schools will compete, but only one will emerge victorious! Let’s get started with Round 1!”</p>

  <p>The first few rounds passed by in a blur. Kaito, Miyu, and Rin worked well as a team, answering questions in rapid succession. Rin was quick to handle the science and math questions, Miyu took charge of the language and literature ones, while Kaito filled in the gaps with history and general knowledge. They were off to a strong start, but as the competition progressed, the difficulty of the questions increased—and so did the pressure.</p>

  <p>Kaito could feel his palms getting sweaty as the rounds went on. The other teams were sharp, especially Kei’s. Every time they scored a point, Kei’s team seemed to match them or even surpass them. The scoreboard showed them fluctuating between the top five positions, and with each new round, Kaito felt the pressure mount.</p>

  <p>By the time they reached the final round, only ten schools remained in the competition. Kaito’s team was in fourth place, just one point behind Kei’s.</p>

  <p>The announcer’s voice echoed through the auditorium. “This is it, folks! The final round will determine our top three teams. The questions will be more challenging, so stay sharp!”</p>

  <p>Kaito clenched his fists, trying to steady his breathing. He looked at Miyu and Rin, both of whom seemed focused, though Miyu gave him a small smile of encouragement.</p>

  <p>The final round began, and the questions were relentless. Complex equations, obscure historical facts, and intricate scientific theories were thrown at them in rapid succession. Kaito’s mind was racing, trying to keep up, but for every question they answered correctly, it felt like Kei’s team was right on their heels.</p>

  <p>Then came the final question.</p>

  <p>“This question will determine the top three,” the announcer said, the tension in the room palpable. “Which element has the highest melting point of any metal?”</p>

  <p>Kaito’s heart skipped a beat. He knew the answer. He’d read about it just the night before. He wrote it on the whiteboard as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>“Tungsten,” he wrote confidently.</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence before the announcer’s voice broke through. “Correct! The answer is Tungsten!”</p>

  <p>A wave of relief washed over Kaito, but it was short-lived as he looked up at the scoreboard. Kei’s team had answered a few seconds faster, earning them just enough points to secure second place. Kaito’s heart sank as he saw their final position: third.</p>

  <p>The announcer’s voice rang out again. “And in third place, with an impressive performance, congratulations to Seiryu High School!”</p>

  <p>There was a brief moment of stunned silence before Miyu let out a whoop of excitement. “Third place! We did it!”</p>

  <p>Kaito blinked, still processing the outcome. Third place wasn’t a win, but it was still something. They had made it to the podium, and that was more than he’d expected after such an intense competition.</p>

  <p>Rin, ever composed, nodded in approval. “Not bad. We’ll be ready for next time.”</p>

  <p>Kaito felt a mix of emotions—relief, pride, and maybe a little disappointment. But as Miyu clapped him on the back, her eyes sparkling with excitement, he couldn’t help but smile.</p>

  <p>They walked up to the stage to claim their prize, a modest cash reward of 10,000 yen. As they accepted the prize, Kei approached them again, grinning. “You guys were great. I didn’t expect you to give us such a hard time.”</p>

  <p>Kaito smiled back, feeling a little more at ease. “You too, Kei. We’ll get you next time.”</p>

  <p>Kei winked. “Looking forward to it.”</p>

  <p>As they left the stage, Kaito glanced at his teammates—Rin, as serious as ever, and Miyu, still buzzing with energy. Despite the pressure and the intensity, they had done it. They had made it to the top three, and they had done it together.</p>
