    <h2>Chapter 1: A Flower's Reflection</h2>
    <p>Kaito Tanaka stared at his phone screen, the bright glow piercing through the dim light of his bedroom. His thumb hovered over the message notification, unsure if he wanted to read it again. But like a moth drawn to a flame, he tapped the screen, and Yumi’s words flooded his mind once more.</p>

    <p>"Kaito, I'm sorry, but I don't think this is working anymore. I've been feeling like this for a while, but I didn't know how to say it... Our relationship just feels so... bland. You never made me feel special. You never surprised me or did anything that made me feel like you really cared."</p>

    <p>Kaito swallowed hard, his heart pounding against his chest. He continued reading, even though he had already memorized every word.</p>

    <p>"Honestly, I think I was happier with my ex. He knew how to make me laugh, how to make me feel important. With you, everything feels... flat. I need someone who can be there for me in a way you just haven't been."</p>

    <p>He clenched his jaw, feeling a mix of anger and shame. The comparison to her ex stung more than anything. He tossed his phone onto his bed and ran his hands through his hair, tugging at it in frustration.</p>

    <p>"What was I even thinking?" he muttered to himself, pacing back and forth in his small room. The pale moonlight filtered through the curtains, casting long shadows on the walls, as if mocking him.</p>

    <p>Kaito sat down at his desk, staring blankly at his reflection in the mirror propped up beside his textbooks. The boy looking back at him seemed ordinary—dark hair slightly tousled, brown eyes filled with doubt, and a furrowed brow that spoke of insecurities he didn’t even know he had.</p>

    <p><em>Was I really that bad?</em> he wondered. <em>Did I really make her feel that way?</em></p>

    <p>Kaito sighed deeply, leaning back in his chair. He had always thought their relationship was fine—comfortable, even. They shared laughs, went on dates, and talked late into the night about school and their favorite shows. But maybe that was the problem. It was all surface-level. There were no grand gestures, no moments that took her breath away. It was just... routine.</p>

    <p><em>Maybe I was too complacent,</em> Kaito thought, running his fingers over the edge of his desk. The memories of their relationship started playing in his mind like a movie—except this was no romantic comedy. This was a story about two people drifting apart without even realizing it.</p>

    <p>For the next few weeks, Kaito kept to himself, avoiding Yumi and their mutual friends. He needed time to think, to process everything that had happened. The more he thought about it, the more he realized how little effort he had put into their relationship. He had taken Yumi for granted, assuming that just being together was enough. But it wasn’t. She deserved more, and so did he.</p>

    <p>By the time the new school year rolled around, Kaito had changed—at least on the surface. He had spent the summer focusing on himself, trying to become a better version of who he was. He had joined a school publication club, picked up a few new hobbies, and even worked part-time at a café. But despite his best efforts, the lingering doubts from his breakup with Yumi still haunted him.</p>

    <p>Kaito entered the gates of Seiryu High School as a 10th grader, the familiar buzz of student chatter filling the air. He took a deep breath, determined to make this year different. “This is a fresh start”, he told himself.</p>

    <p>As the days passed, Kaito settled into his new routine. He focused on his studies, participated in class more, and made an effort to engage with his classmates. It was during a group project in science class that he first met Hinami Miyamoto.</p>

    <p>Hinami was different from anyone Kaito had met before. She was bubbly and energetic, with a smile that seemed to brighten up the entire room. Unlike Yumi, who was more reserved, Hinami was outgoing and spontaneous. She wasn’t afraid to speak her mind or crack a joke, even if it was at her own expense.</p>

    <p>One afternoon, as their group project wrapped up, Hinami turned to Kaito with a grin. “Hey, Kaito, want to grab a snack after school? There’s a new place that opened up nearby, and I’ve been dying to check it out.”</p>

    <p>Kaito blinked in surprise. “Uh, sure. Sounds good.”</p>

    <p>“Great! Meet me at the front gate after class.” With that, Hinami skipped off, leaving Kaito standing there, slightly bewildered but amused.</p>

    <p>True to her word, Hinami was waiting for him at the school gates, her usual cheerful expression in place. They walked together to the new snack shop, chatting about everything and nothing. For the first time in months, Kaito felt at ease—like he didn’t have to pretend to be okay or put on a brave face.</p>

    <p>As they sat at a small table by the window, munching on taiyaki, Hinami leaned forward with a curious look. “So, what’s been on your mind lately? You seem like you’ve been thinking a lot.”</p>

    <p>Kaito hesitated, staring at the pastry in his hands. “Just… life, I guess. Relationships, mostly.”</p>

    <p>“Ah, the tricky stuff,” Hinami nodded knowingly. “Any girl trouble?”</p>

    <p>Kaito chuckled, though it was tinged with sadness. “You could say that. I broke up with someone last year. It wasn’t pretty.”</p>

    <p>Hinami’s expression softened. “That must’ve been hard. You don’t seem like the type to let go of things easily.”</p>

    <p>Kaito sighed, leaning back in his chair. “Yeah, it was. I didn’t realize how much I was messing up until it was too late. She said some things that made me really think about who I am.”</p>

    <p>Hinami was silent for a moment, then she smiled gently. “You know, it’s good that you’re reflecting on it. Not everyone does that. But don’t be too hard on yourself, Kaito. Relationships are a two-way street. It’s not just about what you did wrong, but what you both could’ve done better.”</p>

    <p>Kaito looked at her, surprised by the depth of her words. “You’re right. I’ve been so focused on my own faults that I didn’t consider that.”</p>

    <p>Hinami grinned, nudging him with her elbow. “That’s what friends are for, right? To help you see the bigger picture.”</p>

    <p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the world in twilight, Kaito felt a sense of peace he hadn’t felt in a long time. Maybe things hadn’t worked out with Yumi, but that didn’t mean he was doomed to repeat his mistakes. With Hinami by his side, he felt like he could start fresh, with a clearer understanding of who he was and what he wanted.</p>

    <p>And maybe, just maybe, he could find something even better than what he had before.</p>
