<h2>Chapter 18: Storm</h2>

<p>Kaito stood by the window in his room, staring out at the gray clouds gathering over the city. There was a chill in the air that seeped through the glass, but he barely felt it. His mind was elsewhere, caught up in the pieces of Hinami that didn’t quite fit together anymore. The girl he loved was pulling away, piece by piece, slipping through his fingers no matter how hard he tried to hold on.</p>

<p>For days now, Kaito had noticed the way Hinami looked right past him, her eyes clouded with something distant, something he couldn’t reach. She’d been canceling plans, dodging his calls, and giving him hollow reassurances that everything was fine. But he knew her too well to believe that. Hinami wasn’t fine, and it tore at him that she couldn’t or wouldn’t share what was hurting her.</p>

<p>A soft knock at the door pulled him from his thoughts, and his mother poked her head in, her face lined with concern. “Are you okay, Kaito?” she asked gently, her voice like a lifeline pulling him from the spiral he’d been trapped in.</p>

<p>He managed a tight smile. “Yeah, just... thinking,” he replied, though he knew it sounded hollow.</p>

<p>She nodded, lingering for a moment longer as if sensing the turmoil inside him before leaving him alone with his thoughts again.</p>

<p>After what felt like hours, he made up his mind. <em>I need to talk to her,</em> he thought, steeling himself with a resolve he wasn’t entirely sure he felt. He grabbed his coat and stepped outside, the cold wind hitting his face like a wake-up call. He could feel the weight of what he was about to do pressing down on him, but he couldn’t go on like this—not without knowing what was really happening between them.</p>

<hr>

<p>When Kaito arrived at Hinami’s house, he was greeted by the sight of her standing outside, looking lost and fragile against the backdrop of the looming storm clouds. She hadn’t noticed him yet, her gaze fixed on the ground, her hands clutching her coat tightly around herself as if trying to shield herself from the world.</p>

<p>“H-Hinami!” he called, his voice breaking the silence between them.</p>

<p>She looked up, her eyes widening slightly in surprise before quickly masking her expression. But he could see the cracks—the way her shoulders sagged, the way her eyes looked slightly red as if she’d been crying.</p>

<p>“Kaito,” she replied softly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>

<p>He walked up to her, his heart pounding as he searched her face, hoping to find something, anything, that would help him understand the distance growing between them.</p>

<p>“Hinami… I can’t keep doing this. I can’t keep pretending that I don’t notice what’s going on,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “You’re hurting, and I can see it. Please, just tell me what’s wrong.”</p>

<p>She looked away, her jaw tightening as she wrapped her arms around herself. He watched as she took a shaky breath, her entire frame trembling as if she was fighting some inner battle. For a moment, he thought she might brush him off again, tell him that everything was fine. But then, slowly, painfully, she spoke.</p>

<p>“My family… it’s falling apart, Kaito,” she whispered, her voice laced with a vulnerability he’d never heard before. “My parents... they’re constantly fighting, and I’m caught in the middle. Every night, it’s the same thing. The yelling, the tension… I can’t escape it. I feel like I’m drowning.”</p>

<p>Kaito’s heart ached as he listened, his hand instinctively reaching out to touch her arm. She flinched slightly but didn’t pull away.</p>

<p>“Hinami… I had no idea it was this bad. Why didn’t you tell me sooner?” he asked, his voice thick with concern.</p>

<p>She shook her head, a bitter smile crossing her lips. “Because… because I didn’t want to drag you into this, Kaito. You’re… you’re the best thing in my life right now, the one person who makes me feel like everything might be okay. But I can’t even hold onto that without feeling guilty. I feel like I’m just pulling you down with me.”</p>

<p>His hand tightened on her arm. “Hinami, don’t say that. You don’t have to carry this all on your own. I’m here, and I want to be here with you. Whatever it is, we can get through it together.”</p>

<p>She looked up at him, her eyes filled with a mixture of hope and despair. “Kaito, you don’t understand. It’s not that simple. My family issues… they’re breaking me. I don’t know who I am anymore. I’m just… I’m just a mess, and I can’t ask you to be with someone like that.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not alone in this,” he insisted, his voice breaking slightly as he struggled to keep his composure. “You don’t have to push me away just because things are hard. I want to help you. I want to be there for you, no matter what.”</p>

<p>Hinami’s eyes filled with tears, and she looked away, biting her lip as she tried to hold back the sobs threatening to escape. “Kaito… it’s not fair to you. You deserve someone who can give you everything, someone who isn’t constantly weighed down by their own problems. And right now, that’s not me.”</p>

<p>He reached out, gently brushing a tear from her cheek as she looked up at him, her gaze filled with heartbreak. “I don’t need you to be perfect, Hinami. I just need you to be you. That’s enough for me.”</p>

<p>Her face crumpled, and she closed her eyes, the tears streaming down her cheeks. “I wish it were that simple. I really do. But every time I look at you, all I can think about is how unfair this is to you. You deserve someone who can stand beside you without bringing you down, someone who can make you as happy as you make me.”</p>

<p>Kaito felt his own eyes sting with tears as he listened to her, the pain in her voice piercing him like a knife. “You’re the one I want, Hinami. Flaws, problems, everything. I don’t care about any of that. I just… I just want to be with you.”</p>

<p>She let out a shaky breath, her hands coming up to cover her face as she tried to pull herself together. But he could see the resolve in her eyes, the finality that broke his heart all over again.</p>

<p>“Kaito… please don’t make this harder than it already is,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I’ve already made up my mind. I can’t keep doing this—not to you, not to myself. As much as it hurts, I need to let you go.”</p>

<p>His chest felt like it was being crushed, and he struggled to breathe as her words settled over him like a cold, unforgiving truth. “But… but we can work through it. We can find a way, Hinami. Please, just… don’t give up on us.”</p>

<p>She shook her head, a sad, wistful smile crossing her face. “It’s not about giving up. It’s about knowing my own limits. I love you, Kaito… but I can’t love you the way you deserve, not when I’m fighting my own battles. And I can’t ask you to wait for me to figure it out.”</p>

<p>He wanted to scream, to beg her to reconsider, to tell her that he didn’t care about any of it as long as they could be together. But he could see it in her eyes—the certainty, the heartbreak, the silent plea for him to let her go.</p>

<p>As her words hung in the air, Kaito felt his own resolve crumble. The realization hit him like a tidal wave, drowning him in a sorrow he wasn’t ready to face. She was really leaving him.</p>

<p>“Hinami…” His voice was barely a whisper, his throat tight with the weight of the words he couldn’t bring himself to say.</p>

<p>She looked at him, her eyes filled with tears and an overwhelming sadness that mirrored his own. And then, before he could reach for her, before he could stop her, she turned and walked away, her figure retreating into the shadows as the first drops of rain began to fall.</p>

<p>Kaito stood there, his heart shattering with every step she took. He wanted to run after her, to pull her back into his arms, to tell her that they could make it through anything as long as they were together. But deep down, he knew she wouldn’t come back.</p>

<p>The rain poured down, soaking him to the bone as he stood alone, the weight of her absence pressing down on him like a lead blanket. He wrapped his arms around himself, feeling the cold seep into his skin, mirroring the emptiness left behind in her wake.</p>

<p>And as the storm raged on around him, Kaito felt the finality of it settle over him, the bitter truth that she was gone—and with her, a part of himself he would never get back.</p>
