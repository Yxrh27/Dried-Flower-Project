<h2>Chapter 17: Weight of Silence</h2>

<p>Hinami laid curled up on her bed, staring at the soft glow of her bedside lamp. The room was silent, the only sounds the faint hum of the city beyond her window and the quiet, muffled voices of her parents arguing downstairs. They’d tried to be discreet, speaking in hushed tones and shutting their bedroom door, but the walls of their house did little to contain the tension, and she could hear every strained word.</p>

<p>She pressed her face into her pillow, clutching it tightly as if it might muffle the ache building inside her. It was the same almost every night now—a painful, routine reminder of how fragile her world had become. Each argument was a crack in the foundation, and she was left watching the walls around her slowly collapse.</p>

<p><em>How did things get this way?</em> she wondered, her thoughts drifting as tears pricked at the corners of her eyes. <em>And why do I feel so trapped, even when I’m with Kaito?</em></p>

<p>Hinami’s mind floated back to the days when things felt light, uncomplicated. Back when she and Kaito had first started getting close, she’d felt alive in a way she hadn’t in a long time. He had a warmth about him, a presence that made her feel safe, made her forget the storm brewing at home.</p>

<p>But now, the weight of her own burdens was pressing down on her, clouding her every thought, every feeling. No matter how much she cared for him, she was beginning to realize that her issues were like an invisible wall between them—one she couldn’t seem to tear down.</p>

<hr>

<p>Late into the night, Hinami lay wide awake, her mind too crowded with worries to sleep. She’d tried to distract herself earlier, skimming through old text messages from Kaito, smiling at his funny, random comments and the way he always knew how to make her laugh. But tonight, her heart couldn’t be soothed by his words alone.</p>

<p>She reached for her phone on impulse, fingers hovering over his contact name, her thumb poised to type a message. She wanted to tell him everything—how she was feeling, how scared she was about her family, how she felt herself slipping into this dark place and didn’t know how to find her way out.</p>

<p>But as quickly as the urge came, it faded. She couldn’t bring herself to do it. Kaito was the best thing that had happened to her, the one steady light in her life right now, and she couldn’t bear to burden him with all of this. He deserved someone who could be fully present, someone who could meet his warmth with an open heart, unencumbered by the weight she carried.</p>

<p>Instead, she let her phone fall back onto her bed and curled into herself, letting the tears come silently, streaming down her cheeks and soaking into her pillow. Every night seemed to end this way, with her heart heavy and her body drained, her mind endlessly circling back to the same thought:</p>

<p><em>I’m not enough for him—not right now, and maybe not ever.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>The next day, Hinami moved through school like she was on autopilot. She forced smiles, nodded at the right moments, and laughed when expected, but everything felt distant, like she was floating just outside her own body, watching herself play a part. She avoided Kaito as much as she could, hoping he wouldn’t notice the way her smile didn’t quite reach her eyes.</p>

<p>But he did notice—of course he did. Kaito had always been perceptive when it came to her, and she knew he could sense the change. He’d confronted her the other day, his voice soft yet full of concern, asking if something was wrong. She’d brushed him off, offering a weak excuse, and he’d accepted it, though she could tell he didn’t fully believe her.</p>

<p>It broke her heart to push him away, to see the hurt flicker across his face when she canceled plans or sidestepped his attempts at deeper conversations. She hated herself for it, but every time she saw him, every time she felt his warmth, it only reminded her of how far she was drifting, of how much of herself she was losing to this storm in her life.</p>

<hr>

<p>That afternoon, Hinami found herself wandering to a quiet spot behind the school, a place where she could be alone with her thoughts. She leaned against a tree, gazing out at the empty field as the late afternoon sun cast a golden glow over the grass. She wrapped her arms around herself, feeling the cold bite of reality settling in.</p>

<p>She wanted so desperately to hold onto Kaito, to keep their relationship intact, but she knew it wasn’t fair—not to him, not when she couldn’t give him the part of herself he deserved. Every time she saw him smile, every time he looked at her with that unguarded affection in his eyes, she felt the weight of her own inadequacy bearing down on her.</p>

<p>Her parents’ voices from last night echoed in her mind, their harsh words and bitter accusations leaving a scar she couldn’t erase. She was tired—tired of being torn between two worlds, tired of feeling like she was falling apart, unable to catch herself.</p>

<p>Hinami’s thoughts drifted to the moments she’d spent with Kaito, the laughter they’d shared, the quiet times when it had felt like they were the only two people in the world. She could almost feel his hand in hers, his fingers intertwined with hers in that gentle way of his, as if he was afraid of hurting her.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes, fighting back the wave of emotions threatening to overwhelm her. She wanted to be that girl he looked at with so much hope, the girl who could stand beside him without feeling like a weight dragging him down.</p>

<p><em>But I can’t,</em> she realized, the thought piercing her like a shard of ice. <em>I can’t keep pretending everything is okay. He deserves more than this… more than me.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>That evening, Hinami went home, her resolve hardening as she tried to prepare herself for what she knew she had to do. She spent the night sitting by her window, watching the city lights twinkle in the distance, feeling the sharp, bitter ache of letting go.</p>

<p>Part of her wished she could tell him everything, that she could pour her heart out and trust him to understand. But even as the thought crossed her mind, she knew it wouldn’t be enough. No words could fix the brokenness inside her, and no amount of love could erase the pain her family’s struggles had etched into her soul.</p>

<p>She couldn’t ask Kaito to shoulder that weight—not when it was hers to carry. He was kind, caring, everything she’d ever wanted, but that was precisely why she had to let him go. She couldn’t keep dragging him into her darkness, not when she knew she wasn’t strong enough to pull them both out.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next day, Hinami watched Kaito from across the courtyard, her heart aching as she took in the way he laughed with Ryo and Miyu, the way his face lit up as he spoke, oblivious to the turmoil she was drowning in.</p>

<p>He looked over, catching her eye for a moment, and she forced herself to smile, though it felt hollow. He smiled back, a warmth in his gaze that made her heart clench painfully. She wanted so desperately to walk over, to let him wrap her in his arms and tell her everything would be okay. But she knew that if she did, she’d never have the strength to say goodbye.</p>

<p>Instead, she stood rooted to the spot, watching him with a mix of longing and heartbreak. She felt like an intruder in her own life, watching her own happiness slip further and further away. She knew the moment was coming, that soon she’d have to face him and tell him the truth.</p>

<p>The thought left her trembling, her hands clenched into fists as she struggled to hold back the tears threatening to spill over. She loved him—that much she knew. But love, she was beginning to realize, wasn’t always enough to bridge the distance between two people. Sometimes, no matter how much you cared, the weight of your own pain was too great to carry alongside someone else’s.</p>

<p><em>I’ll do it soon,</em> she promised herself, her heart breaking a little more with each silent word. <em>I’ll end it before I hurt him even more.</em></p>

<p>And as she turned away, leaving the courtyard and the warmth of Kaito’s gaze behind her, she felt a piece of herself shatter, lost to the emptiness she couldn’t escape.</p>
